<p>I belong to the great and mystic brotherhood of mountain
worshippers. We are a motley crowd drawn from all lands and all ages,
and we are certainly a peculiar people. The sight and smell of the
mountain affect us like nothing else on earth. In some of us they
arouse excessive physical energy and lust of conquest in a manner not
unlike that which suggests itself to the terrier at the sight of a
rat. We must master the heights above, and we become slaves to the
climbing impulse, itinerant purveyors of untold energy, marking the
events of our lives on peaks and passes. We may merit to the full
Ruskin's scathing indictment of those who look upon the Alps as soaped
poles in a bear-garden which we set ourselves &ldquo;to climb and
slide down again with shrieks of delight,&rdquo; we
<!-- Page 8 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
may become top-fanatics and record-breakers, &ldquo;red with cutaneous
eruption of conceit,&rdquo; but we are happy with a happiness which
passeth the understanding of the poor people in the plains.</p>

<p>Others experience no acceleration of physical energy, but a strange
rousing of all their mental faculties. Prosaic, they become
poetical&mdash;the poetry may be unutterable, but it is there;
commonplace, they become eccentric; severely practical, they become
dreamers and loiterers upon the hillside. The sea, the wood, the
meadow cannot compete with the mountain in egging on the mind of man
to incredible efforts of expression. The songs, the rhapsodies, the
poems, the æsthetic ravings of mountain worshippers have a dionysian
flavour which no other scenery can impart.</p>

<p>Yesterday I left the turmoil of a conference in Geneva and reached
home amongst my delectable mountains. I took train for the foot of the
hills and climbed for many hours through drifts of snow. This morning
I have been deliciously mad. First I greeted the sun from my open
chalet window as it rose over the range on my left and lit up the
great glacier before me, throwing the distant hills into a glorious
dream-world of blue and
<!-- Page 9 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
purple. Then I plunged into the huge drifts of clean snow which the
wind had piled up outside my door. I laughed with joy as I breathed
the pure air, laden with the scent of pines and the diamond-dust of
snow. I never was more alive, the earth was never more beautiful, the
heavens were never nearer than they are to-day. Who says we are
prisoners of darkness? Who says we are puppets of the devil? Who says
God must only be worshipped in creeds and churches? Here are the
glories of the mountains, beauty divine, peace perfect, power
unfathomable, love inexhaustible, a never failing source of hope and
light for our struggling human race. I am vaguely aware of the
unreasonableness of my delirium of mountain joy, but I revel in
it. And I sing with Sir Lewis Morris&mdash;</p>

<p>The emotions engendered by mountain scenery defy analysis. They may
be classified and labelled, but not explained. I turn to my library of
books by mountain-lovers
<!-- Page 10 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
&mdash;climbers, artists, poets, scientists. Though we are solitaries
in our communion with the Deity, though we worship in great spaces of
solitude and silence and seek rejuvenescence in utter human
loneliness, we do not despise counsels of sympathy and approval.  The
strife rewarded, the ascent accomplished, we are profoundly grateful
for the yodel of human fellowship. And&mdash;let me whisper it in
confidence&mdash;we do not despise the cooking-pots. For the mountains
have a curious way of lifting you up to the uttermost confines of the
spirit and then letting you down to the lowest dominions of the
flesh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Examine the nature of your own emotion (if you feel it) at
the sight of the Alps,&rdquo; says Ruskin, &ldquo;and you find all the
brightness of that emotion hanging like dew on a gossamer, on a
curious web of subtle fancy and imperfect knowledge.&rdquo; Such a
result of our examination would but add to our confusion. Ruskin's
mind was so permeated with adoration of mountain scenery that his
attempts at cool analysis of his own sensations failed, as would those
of a priest who, worshipping before the altar, tried at the same time
to give an analytical account of his state of mind.  Ruskin
<!-- Page 11 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
is the stern high priest of the worshippers of mountains; to him they
are cathedrals designed by their glory and their gloom to lift
humanity out of its baser self into the realization of high destinies.
The fourth volume of <i>Modern Painters</i> was the fount of
inspiration from which Leslie Stephen and the early members of the
Alpine Club drank their first draughts of mountaineering
enthusiasm. But the disciples never reached the heights of the
teacher. Listen to the exposition by the Master of the services
appointed to the hills:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To fill the thirst of the human heart for the beauty of
God's working&mdash;to startle its lethargy with a deep and pure
agitation of astonishment&mdash;are their higher missions. They are as
a great and noble architecture, first giving shelter, comfort, and
rest; and covered also with mighty sculpture and painted
legend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a solemn stateliness about Ruskin's descriptions of the
mountains, which in the last passage of the chapter on <i>The Mountain
Gloom</i> rises to the impassioned cadences of the prophet.</p>

<p>He could tolerate no irreverent spirits in the sanctuary of the
mountain. Leslie Stephen's

remark that the Alps were improved by tobacco smoke became a
profanity. One shudders at the thought of the reprimand which
Stevenson would have drawn down upon himself had his flippant messages
from the Alps come before that austere critic. In a letter to Charles
Baxter, Stevenson complained of how &ldquo;rotten&rdquo; he had been
feeling &ldquo;alone with my weasel-dog and my German maid, on the top
of a hill here, heavy mist and thin snow all about me and the devil to
pay in general.&rdquo; And worse still are the lines sent to a
friend&mdash;</p>

<p>The soul of Ruskin was born and fashioned for the mountains. His
first visit to Switzerland in 1833 brought him to &ldquo;the Gates of
the Hills&mdash;opening for me a new life&mdash;to cease no more
except at the Gates of the Hills whence
<!-- Page 13 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
one returns not. It is not possible to imagine,&rdquo; he adds of his
first sight of the Alps, &ldquo;in any time of the world a more
blessed entrance into life for a child of such temperament as
mine.... I went down that evening from the garden terrace of
Schaffhausen with my devotion fixed in all of it that was to be sacred
and useful.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor" id="FNanchor"></a>

<i>Life of Ruskin</i>, by Sir Edward Cooke (George Allen and Unwin Ltd.).
</p></div>

<p>That profound stirring of the depths of the soul which Ruskin
avowed as the impetus to his life's work is only possible when the
mind is fired by a devotion to the mountains which brooks no
rival. &ldquo;For, to myself, mountains are the beginning and the end
of all natural scenery,&rdquo; he wrote in <i>The Mountain Glory</i>;
&ldquo;in them, and in the forms of inferior landscape that lead to
them, my affections are wholly bound up.&rdquo; And he completely and
forever reversed Dante's dismal conception of scenery befitting souls
in purgatory by saying that &ldquo;the best image which the world can
give of Paradise is in the slope of the meadows, orchards, and
cornfields on the sides of a great Alp, with its purple rocks and
eternal snows above.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No lover of mountains has approached Ruskin
<!-- Page 14 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
in intensity of veneration.  Emile Javelle is not far away. Javelle
climbed as by a religious impulse; his imagination was filled by
Alpine shapes; he, like Ruskin, had forfeited his heart to the
invisible snow-maiden that dwells above the clouds. When Javelle was a
child his uncle showed him a collection of plants, and amongst them
the &ldquo;Androsace ... rochers du Mont Blanc.&rdquo; This roused the
desire to climb; the faded bit of moss with the portion of earth still
clinging to the roots became a sacred relic beckoning him to the
shrine of the white mountain. In the same way Ruskin, mature and
didactic, yet withal so beautifully childlike, tells us &ldquo;that a
wild bit of ferny ground under a fir or two, looking as if possibly
one might see a hill if one got to the other side, will instantly give
me intense delight because the shadow, the hope of the hills is in
them.&rdquo; Both lovers showed the same disdain of the mere
climber. Javelle's Alpine memories record his sense of aloofness from
the general type of member of the Alpine Club.</p>

<p>Whilst Ruskin's communion with the mountains found an outlet in
prolific literary output, and a system of art and ethics destined to
<!-- Page 15 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
leaven the mass of human thought, the infinitude and grandeur of
mountain scenery had a dispersive effect on Javelle's mind. I can so
well understand him.  He wandered over the chain of Valais&mdash;my
mountains (each worshipper has his special idols)&mdash;the Dent du
Midi, the Vaudois Alps, and the Bernese Oberland in search of beauty,
more and more beauty. He ascended peak after peak, attracted by an
irresistible force, permeated by a desire for new points of view,
forgetful of the haunts of men.</p>

<p>And when, between times, Javelle tried to write a book, a great and
learned book on rhetoric, he could never finish it. For seven years he
laboured at preparing it, collecting notes, seeking corroborative
evidence. His Alpine climbing had taught him the elusiveness of
isolated peaks of knowledge. He saw that rhetoric is dependent on
æsthetics and æsthetics on psychology and sociology and philosophy,
and all on anthropology; that there are no frontiers and no finality
and no knowledge which is not relative and imperfect. It was all a
question of different tops and points of view, and so the book was not
finished when he died, still in search of the super-mountain
<!-- Page 16 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
of the widest and largest view, still crying out his motto,
&ldquo;Onward, higher and higher still! You must reach the
top!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beware, O fellow mountaineers, of such ambitions. For that way
madness lies. I know the lure and the shock. As I write this I sit
gazing across the valley upon the mountain on my right. It is known by
the name of the Black Head; it has a sombre shape, it has never been
known to smile. It towers above me with a cone-shaped top, a figure of
might and dominion.  For a dozen years it has checked my tendency to
idealistic flights by reminding me of the inexorable laws of
Nature. It is true it does not conceal the smiling glacier in front of
me, with its ceaseless play of light and shadow, colour and form, but
it arrests the fancy by its massive immovability. And yet, when I
leave my little abode of bliss and wander forth into the heights above
(ah, humiliation that there should be heights above), I find my black
top subjected to a process of shrinking. As I reach the top it
ignominiously permits itself to be flattened out to a mere ridge
without a head, a Lilliputian hill bemoaning its own
insignificance.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 17 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
</div>

<p>Such are the illusions of the mountain play. Yet the climb and the
heights have ever served man as a symbol of the search for certainty.
Lecky invokes the heights as the only safe place from which to view
history and discover the great permanent forces through which nations
are moved to improvement or decay. Schopenhauer compares philosophy to
an Alpine road, often bringing the wanderer to the edge of the chasm,
but rewarding him as he ascends with oblivion of the discords and
irregularities of the world. Nietzsche's wisdom becomes pregnant upon
lonely mountains; he claims that whosoever seeks to enter into this
wisdom &ldquo;must be accustomed to live on mountain-tops and see
beneath him the wretched ephemeral gossip of politics and national
egoism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the mountain-tops make sport of the certainties of philosophers
as well as of those of fools. The safest plan is to ascend them
without too heavy an encumbrance of theories. You may then meet
fairies and goblins who beckon you to the caves of mystery, you may
stray into the hills of Arcadia and meet Pan himself. &ldquo;Sweet the
piping of him who sat upon the rocks and fluted to the morning
sea.&rdquo;

You may even find yourself on Olympus, the mount of a thousand folds,
listening to the everlasting assault upon the Gods by the Titans, sons
of strife. And if you are very patient you may witness Zeus, the
lightning-gatherer, pierce the black clouds and rend the sky,
illuminating hill and vale with the fierce light which makes even the
battle of Troy intelligible.</p>

<p>You may bathe your soul in that Natura Maligna which only reveals
its blessings to pagans and poets. Byron is the chosen bard of the
destructive might of the mountains&mdash;</p>

<p>Whilst the poets chant the awful power of the distant mountain,
Byron comes to us out of the mountain, fashioned by its force,
intoxicated by the wine of its wild life. Mountain climbers meet with
strange and unexpected bedfellows in the course of their
wanderings. In his cry for the baptism of the wild winds of the
mountain, Matthew Arnold approaches Byron closely&mdash;</p>

<p>Shelley sings exquisitely of its grandeur, its ceaseless motion; he
voices the wonderment of man before the complex problem of Mont Blanc.
But his mind has never participated in the revels on the mountain, he
has not lost and barely recovered his soul in adventurous
crevasses. He retains something of the old horror of the desolate
heights&mdash;</p>

<p>Nearly all the poets have been moved by the primitive sense of
their awe-commanding power. Wordsworth never forgets the blackness,
though he is, above all, the bard of mountain light and sweetness, of
warbling birds and maiden's haycocks. The poet does not
<!-- Page 21 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
lose the blessed gift of wonder possessed by children and savages. And
nothing in Nature can startle the mind like the sight of a mighty
range of mountains. They recall primitive feelings of fear before the
great unknown, they tower above the human form with a colossal
imperturbability which withers our importance and confuses our
standards of value. Victor Hugo never quite freed himself from the
mediæval dread of the mountains or the mediæval speculation on their
meaning. His letters to his wife from the Alps and Pyrenees record his
impressions with a painstaking and detailed accuracy which does not
forget the black-and-yellow spider performing somersaults on an
imperceptible thread hung from one brier to another. The emotion after
an hour on the Rigi-Kulm &ldquo;is immense.&rdquo; &ldquo;The tourist
comes here to get a point of view; the thinker finds here an immense
book in which each rock is a letter, each lake is a phrase, each
village is an accent; from it arise, like a smoke, two thousand years
of memories.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here speaks the true panoramic man, the man whose mind attains to
fulness of expression on mountain-tops from which the whole landscape
of life may be contemplated. And
<!-- Page 22 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
yet he notes the &ldquo;ominous configuration of Mount Pilatus&rdquo;
and its terrible form, and writes of adjoining mountains as
&ldquo;these hump-backed, goitred giants crouching around me in the
darkness.&rdquo; The Rigi appears as &ldquo;a dark and monstrous
perpendicular wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His mind is occupied with the presence of idiots in the Alps. He
finds an explanation: &ldquo;It is not granted to all intelligences to
co-habit with such marvels and to keep from morning till evening
without intoxication and without stupor, turning a visual radius of
fifty leagues across the earth around a circumference of three
hundred.&rdquo; On the Rigi his musings on the magnificence of the
view are checked by the presence of a cretin.  Behold the contrast! An
idiot with a goitre and an enormous face, a blank stare, and a stupid
laugh is sole participator with Victor Hugo in this &ldquo;marvellous
festival of the mountains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! abysm!&rdquo; he cries; &ldquo;the Alps were the
spectacle, the spectator was an idiot! I forgot myself in this
frightful antithesis: man face to face with nature; Nature in her
superbest aspect, man in his most miserable debasement. What could be
the significance of this mysterious
<!-- Page 23 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
contrast?  What was the sense of this irony in a solitude? Have I the
right to believe that the landscape was designed for him&mdash;the
cretin, and the irony for me&mdash;the chance visitor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The idiot and the mountain shared, no doubt, a supreme indifference
to the commotion which their proximity had set up in the poet's
mind. With his love of antithesis Hugo had seized the picture of the
glories of the mountain wasting themselves before the gaze of the
senseless idiot.  Apart from geographical conditions and hygienic
defects there is an interesting æsthetic problem connected with the
presence of idiots in the mountains. It is not only the idiot who is
indifferent to the beauties of the Alps; the sane and healthy peasant
whose eyes wander over the glaciers and snow-fields as he rests for a
few minutes from hoeing his potatoes is not moved by the sight to
ecstatic delight.</p>

<p>I have many dear friends amongst peasants. They are richly endowed
with common sense and kindness of heart; their brains can compete
favourably with those of the folk of any other country. Their hard
struggle with a rebellious soil has given them a quiet determination
<!-- Page 24 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
and tenacity of purpose which are the root of Alpine enterprise and
resourcefulness.  They possess character and independence in a high
degree&mdash;mental reflexes of the peaks of freedom, ever before
their eyes. But they, children of the mountain, born and bred amidst
its beauties, are surprisingly insensitive to beauty.</p>

<p>I remember one exquisite sunset&mdash;one of those superlative
sunsets that burn themselves into the consciousness with a joy akin to
pain, and of which only a few are allotted to each human life. I stood
watching the sinking sun throw a crimson net over the snow mountains
as the shadow of night crept slowly up the hillside. The sky took on
an opal light in which were merged and transcended all the colours of
the day. Every pinnacle and rock was lit up as by a heavenly fire, the
pines were outlined like black sentinels against the sky, guardians of
that merciful green life from which we spring and to which we
return. My old friend the goat-herd and daily messenger from the
highest pastures stood beside me. &ldquo;Beautiful, Pierre,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;and in this you have lived all your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, slowly shifting the pipe
<!-- Page 25 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
from the left side of his mouth to the right; &ldquo;the cheese is fat
and good in the mountains, and the milk is not poisonous as it is in
the plains, but it is hard work for the back to carry it down twice a
day.&rdquo; He looked at me as if searching for better
understanding. &ldquo;But I will tell you something nice,&rdquo; he
added, by way of stirring up my sluggish imagination; &ldquo;the
little brown cow has calved, and this autumn we are going to kill the
old cow, and we shall have good meat all the winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Far be it from me to join in the thoughtless generalizations about
the obtuseness of the Alpine peasant which have disfigured some of the
literature of climbing. These climbers have shown infinitely greater
obtuseness before Alpine realities than the peasants derided by them.
True, a star may compete in vain with a cheese in suggesting visions
of joy, but our supercilious climbers forget that their admiration of
nature's marvels is generally built up on a substratum of
cheese&mdash;or the equivalent of cheese&mdash;plentifully supplied by
the labour of others.  There is another class of climbers who idealize
the peasant and the guide, and who write of Alpine peasant-life as if
it were
<!-- Page 26 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
nothing but a series of perilous ascents nobly undertaken for the
advancement of humanity.</p>

<p>I can understand the indifference of the peasant to the visions
around him. After a hard day's scything or woodcutting on slopes so
steep that the resistance of one's hob-nailed boots seems like that of
soft soap, I have felt profoundly healthy and ready to go to bed
without listening to any lyrics on the Alps. And even the thought of
Tennyson's &ldquo;awful rose of dawn&rdquo; would not have roused me
before the labour of the next day.</p>

<p>But we&mdash;how proud I am of that &ldquo;we&rdquo;!&mdash;who
have chosen hard labour on the mountain know something which the mere
visitors (though they be members of many Alpine Clubs) know not. We
have a sense of home which no other habitation can impart&mdash;a
passionate love of the soil, a unity with the little patch that is our
own, bringing joys undimmed by any descriptions of other-worldly
possessions. Our trees may be wrecked by an avalanche, our garden plot
may be obliterated by a land slip; the stone walls we build up in
defiance of the snow are always pulled down by mountain sprites. Our
agriculture is precarious, and
<!-- Page 27 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
every carrot is bought by the sweat of our brow. The struggle keeps
pace with our love&mdash;there is a tenfold sweetness in the fruit we
reap. And when fate compels us to leave our mountains we are pursued
by restlessness. We know no peace, no home elsewhere. We do assume the
airs of Victor Hugo's cretin when we are placed face to face with the
riches of Cr&oelig;sus or the splendours of Pharaoh.</p>

<p>We must reluctantly admit that the phenomenon of cold indifference
to mountain scenery may occur without any corresponding degree of
idiocy.  In the <i>Playground of Europe</i>, Leslie Stephen told us
that a man who preserves a stolid indifference in face of mountain
beauty must be of the &ldquo;essentially pachydermatous order.&rdquo;
He commented at length on the peculiar temperament of those who have
expressed dislike of his perfect playground&mdash;Chateaubriand,
Johnson, Addison, Bishop Berkeley. Bishop Berkeley, who crossed Mont
Cenis on New Year's Day 1714, complained that he was &ldquo;put out of
humour by the most horrible precipices.&rdquo; There is huge comfort
to be drawn from Stephen's pages descriptive of the
&ldquo;simple-minded abhorrence of mountains,&rdquo; and from his
categorical declaration
<!-- Page 28 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
that love of the sublime shapes of the Alps springs from &ldquo;a
delicate and cultivated taste.&rdquo; But we are puzzled by the
presence outside the pale of some who cannot rightly be called
&ldquo;pachydermatous.&rdquo; I am turning over the pages of Sarah
Bernhardt's autobiographical revelations. &ldquo;I adore the sea and
the plain,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;but I neither care for mountains
nor for forests. Mountains seem to crush me, and forests to stifle
me.&rdquo; Strange that the high priestess of expression, the
interpreter of every phase of human passion and sorrow, she who dies
terribly twice a day, and mercilessly conducts us to the attenuated
air and dizzy heights of intense emotion, should feel no kinship with
the mountains. It may be that they are antagonistic to the fine arts
of simulation and will brook no companionship of feeling that is not
real.  And her stage-worn heart is certainly not in alliance with
Fiona Macleod's <i>Lonely Hunter</i>.</p>

<p>We might assume that the traditional wildness of the great
tragedienne would have found a chord of sympathy in the avalanche or
in
<!-- Page 29 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the fierce torrent breaking over the rocks. Rousseau's hysteria and
wild assaults on the conventions of Society and literature have been
traced to the mountains. Lord Morley emphasizes that Rousseau
&ldquo;required torrents, rocks, dark forests, mountains, and
precipices,&rdquo; and that no plains, however beautiful, ever seemed
so in his eyes. There is naturally a complete divergence of opinion
between lovers and haters of mountains as to their effect on the
literary mind. We like to associate peaks of genius with peaks of
granite. Ruskin found fault with Shakespeare's lack of impression from
a more sublime country as shown by the sacrilegious lines&mdash;</p>

<p>There are anomalies in the capacity for æsthetic enjoyment of
mountain scenery which exclude some minds which we should expect to
find amongst the devotees and include others for whom we might look
amongst the scoffers. Dickens was profoundly affected by the
mountain-presence. His letters show the true rapture. Of the scenery
of the St.

Gothard he writes: &ldquo;Oh God! what a beautiful country it is. How
poor and shrunken, beside it, is Italy in its brightest aspect!&rdquo;
He sees &ldquo;places of terrible grandeur unsurpassable, I should
imagine, in the world.&rdquo; Going up the Col de Balme, he finds the
wonders &ldquo;above and beyond one's wildest expectations.&rdquo; He
cannot imagine anything in nature &ldquo;more stupendous or
sublime.&rdquo; His impressions are so prodigious that he would rave
were he to write about them. At the hospice of the Great St.  Bernard
he awakes, believing for a moment that he had &ldquo;died in the night
and passed into the unknown world.&rdquo; Tyndall's scientific ballast
cannot keep him from soaring in a similar manner. His <i>Glaciers of
the Alps</i> contains some highly strung sentences of
delight. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he writes of sunset seen near the
Jungfrau, &ldquo;if beauty be an object of worship, these glorious
mountains with rounded shoulders of the purest white, snow-crested,
and star-gemmed, were well calculated to excite sentiments of
adoration.&rdquo; His wealth of words increases with the splendour of
the views in which he revels; he becomes a poet in prose, he calls up
symbol and simile, he strains language to
<!-- Page 31 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
express the inexpressible. The sky of the mountain is &ldquo;rosy
violet,&rdquo; which blends with &ldquo;the deep zenithal blue&rdquo;;
it wears &ldquo;a strange and supernatural air&rdquo;; he sees clear
spaces of amber and ethereal green; the blue light in the cave of the
glacier presents an aspect of &ldquo;magical beauty.&rdquo; There is
true worship of the idol in the following lines descriptive of sunrise
on Mont Blanc:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>The mountain rose for a time cold and grand,
with no apparent stain upon his snows. Suddenly the sunbeams struck
his crown and converted it into a boss of gold. For some time it
remained the only gilded summit in view, holding communion with the
dawn, while all the others waited in silence. These, in the order of
their heights, came afterwards, relaxing, as the sunbeams struck each
in succession, into a blush and smile.</p></div>

<p>Tyndall holds the mastership of polychromatic description of the
beauties of the mountain; he makes us feel his own response to their
call to the depths of æsthetic perception in the human soul. Words
gush forth from him in a fervour of gratitude for the pleasures of the
eye.  He may measure and weigh, he may set out as an emissary of cold
scientific investigation: he returns hot with admiration and raving of
the marvels of God upon the
<!-- Page 32 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
hills. But even he reaches a point where the realization of the utter
inadequacy of expression paralyses the desire to convey the emotion to
others. &ldquo;I was absolutely struck dumb by the extraordinary
majesty of this scene,&rdquo; he writes of one evening, &ldquo;and
watched it silently till the red light faded from the highest
summits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verestchagin astonished his wife by painting his studies of snow in
the Himalayas at an altitude of 14,000 feet, tormented by hunger and
thirst and supported by two coolies, who held him on each side. She
had the pluck and the endurance to follow him on his long climbs, but
being a less exalted mortal, her sense of fitness was unduly strained
by the intensity of Verestchagin's devotion to clouds and
mountain-tops. &ldquo;His face is so frightfully swollen,&rdquo; she
tells us, &ldquo;that his eyes look merely like two wrinkles, the sun
scorches his head, his hand can scarcely hold the palette, and yet he
insists on finishing his sketches.  I cannot imagine,&rdquo; she
reflects, &ldquo;how Verestchagin could make such studies.&rdquo;
There were, nevertheless, occasions when the inaction, following on
intense æsthetic emotion, stayed Verestchagin's busy brush.  One day,
relates
<!-- Page 33 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Madame Verestchagin, he went out to sketch the sunset:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>He prepared his palette, but the sight was
so beautiful that he waited in order to examine it better. Several
thousand feet below us all was wrapped in a pure blue shadow; the
summits of the peaks were resplendent in purple flames. Verestchagin
waited and waited and would not begin his sketch. &ldquo;By and by, by
and by,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I want to look at it still; it is
splendid!&rdquo; He continued to wait, he waited until the end of the
evening&mdash;until the sun was set and the mountains were enveloped
in dark shadows. Then he shut up his paint-box and returned
home.</p></div>

<p>As I read these lines I find myself wondering how many paint-boxes
have been shut up by the sight of the mountains. I know many have been
opened, and, amongst these, not a few which might have served humanity
better by remaining shut. But we may safely assume that despite the
general tendency of mountain worshippers to attempt to paint&mdash;in
colours strong and language divine&mdash;the effect on their minds,
there are exceptional instances of noble and self-imposed
dumbness. Not the dumbness which is practising the old device
of&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em">but a genuine silence of humility before
the mysteries of nature. We sigh in vain for a glimpse of these
exceptional souls. They resist our best climbing qualifications and
are as inaccessible as the mists above our highest tops. And we
prefer, naturally, our talking companions, those who shrink not from
the task of ready interpretation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Alps form a book of nature as wide and mysterious as
Life,&rdquo; says Frederic Harrison in his <i>Alpine Jubilee</i>, in
one of those clear-cut and well-measured passages of mountain homage,
which are balm to the tormented hearts of those who feel themselves
afloat on the clouds of mystery. &ldquo;To know, to feel, to
understand the Alps is to know, to feel, to understand
Humanity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am not at all sure this is true; it is probably entirely untrue.
Humanity&mdash;in the abstract&mdash;is apt to suffer an enforced
reduction in magnitude and importance when seen from Alpine
heights. But it is one of those phrases which we hug instinctively as
the bearers of food for hungry hearts. We do not want Leslie Stephen's
reminder of metaphysical riddles, &ldquo;Where does Mont Blanc end and
where do I begin?&rdquo; We do not
<!-- Page 35 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
want to be paralysed by philosophic doubt for the rest of our mortal
lives on the hills. We prefer to be stirred to emotional life by those
who are transported by love of beauty to the realms of unreason.</p>

<p>In the autobiography of Princess Hélène Racowitza&mdash;the
tragically beloved of Ferdinand Lassalle&mdash;there is evidence of
such transport. She has but reached one of the commonplaces of tourist
ventures. From the Wengern Alp she watches the play of night and dawn
on the Jungfrau:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Again and again the glory of God drew me to
the window. In the immense stillness of the loneliness of the
mountains, the thundering of the avalanches that crashed from time to
time from the opposite heights was the only sound. It was as if one
heard the breath of God, and in deepest reverence one's heart stood
almost still.</p></div>

<p>She beholds the moon pale and the summit of the Jungfrau glitter in
&ldquo;a thousand prismatic colours&rdquo; from the rising sun:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Once more I was shaken to the depths of my
soul, thankful that I was allowed to witness this and to enjoy it
thus. A great joy leapt up in my heart, which more surely than the
most fervent prayer of thanks penetrated to the infinite goodness of
the great Almighty.</p></div>

<p>The sincerity of the religious feeling is enhanced by its
simplicity.  The more complex experiences of the true mystical nature
retain the same intensity of devotional fervour. Anna Kingsford, whose
interpretations of the inner meaning of Christianity place her in the
foremost rank of modern mystics, was caught up to God by the beauty of
the mountains. Her friend and biographer, Edward Maitland, describes
their effect on one in whom a fiercely artistic soul did combat with a
frail and suffering body. It was whilst near the mountains that she
conceived her beautiful utterance on the Poet:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>But the personality of the Poet is Divine: and being Divine, it
hath no limits.</p>

<p>He is supreme and ubiquitous in consciousness: his heart beats in
every Element.</p>

<p>The Pulses of all the infinite Deep of Heaven vibrate in his own:
and responding to their strength and their plenitude, he feels more
intensely than other men.</p>

<p>Not merely he sees and examines these Rocks and Trees: these
variable Waters, and these glittering Peaks.</p>

<p>Not merely he hears this plaintive Wind, these rolling Peals:</p>

<p>But he <span class="smcap">is</span> all these: and with
them&mdash;nay, <span class="smcap">in</span> them&mdash;he rejoices
and weeps, he shines and aspires, he sighs and thunders.</p>

<p>And when he sings, it is not he&mdash;the Man&mdash;whose Voice is heard: it
is the voice of all the Manifold Nature herself.</p>

<p>In his Verse the Sunshine laughs; the Mountains give forth their
sonorous Echoes; the swift Lightnings flash.</p>

<p>The great continual cadence of universal Life moves and becomes
articulate in human language.</p>

<p>O Joy profound! O boundless Selfhood! O Godlike Personality!</p>

<p>All the Gold of the Sunset is thine; the Pillars of Chrysolite; and
the purple Vault of Immensity!</p></div>

<p>Anna Kingsford did not consciously seek the mountains to find there
the release of imprisoned powers of utterance. The mountains sought
her by their beauty and called forth the true mystic's ecstasy of
communion.  Mystics of all times and all religions have found
inspiration and strength of spirit on the hilltops; they have forsaken
the haunts of men for the silence of the heights, preparing themselves
by meditation and self-purification to receive the Beatific
Vision. They have gone up alone in anguish and uncertainty, they have
come down inspired bearers of transcendental tidings to men. These
messengers of the spirit have known the joys of illumination and the
secret of the strength of the hills.</p>

<p>Others have sought in agony and mortification of mind the vision
which was denied them. For in chasing away the images of sin they
forgot to make room for the images of beauty. With Simeon Stylites,
they point to their barren sojourn on the hills:</p>

<div class="blockwide">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Three winters that my soul might grow to thee,</span>
<span class="i0">I lived up there on yonder mountain-side,</span>
<span class="i0">My right leg chained into the crag, I lay</span>
<span class="i0">Pent in a roofless close of ragged stones.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is to the rarefied perception of beauty that we may trace the
quickening of spirit which artists and poets experience on the
mountains. Heine, going to the Alps with winter in his soul,
&ldquo;withered and dead,&rdquo; finds new hope and a new spring. The
melodies of poetry return, he feels once again his valour as a soldier
in the war of liberation of humanity.</p>

<p>The process of unburdening hearts has been continuous since we
discovered the boundless capacity of the hills to hide our shame and
discharge our thunder. Petrarch set the example on the top of Mont
Ventoux when he deliberately recollected and wept over his past
uncleanness and the carnal corruptions of his soul. I never tire of
that dearly sentimental
<!-- Page 39 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
mixture of world-weariness and nature-study which Elisée Reclus called
the <i>History of a Mountain</i>. &ldquo;I was sad, downcast, weary of
my life. Fate had dealt hardly with me: it had robbed me of all who
were dear to me, had ruined my plans, frustrated all my hopes.  People
whom I called my friends had turned against me when they beheld me
assailed by misfortune; all mankind with its conflicting interests and
its unrestrained passions appeared repulsive in my eyes.&rdquo; Thus
he invites us to follow him towards the lofty blue peaks. In the
course of his wanderings he finds Nature's peace and freedom, and as
his love of the mountains expands, kind tolerance returns to his
heart. He takes geological and meteorological notes, he studies men
and beasts on the peaks, and never forgets to draw moralizing
comparisons. The climb is to him the symbol of &ldquo;the toilsome
path of virtue,&rdquo; the difficult passes, the treacherous crevasses
reminders of temptations to be overcome by a sanctified will.</p>

<p>I am afraid modern climbers show scant regard for Elisée Reclus'
rules for moral exercises. Many are moved by an exuberance of physical
energy which rejoices in battle
<!-- Page 40 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
with Nature. They love the struggle and the danger, the exercise and
the excitement. They find health and good temper, jollity and
good-fellowship, through their exertions. They glory shamelessly in
useless scrambles which demand the sweat of their brow and the
concentrated attention of their minds. They seek to emulate the
chamois and the monkey in hanging on to rocks and insecure footholds.
When they do not climb, they fill libraries with descriptions of their
achievements, dull and unintelligible to the uninitiated,
bloodstirring and excellent to the members of the brotherhood. They
write in a jargon of their own of chimneys and buttresses and basins
and ribs, of boulders and saddles and moraine-hopping. They become
rampant at the thought of the stout, unworthy people who are now
dragged to the tops by the help of rope-chains and railings. They
sarcastically remark that they may have to abandon certain
over-exploited peaks through the danger of falling sardine-tins. They
issue directions for climbing calculated to chase away the poet from
the snow-fields, as when Sir Martin Conway says that a certain glacier
must be &ldquo;struck at the right corner of its
<!-- Page 41 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
snout,&rdquo; and &ldquo;its drainage stream flows from the left
corner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They do not hesitate to admit that they would continue to climb
even if there were no views to be enjoyed from the tops. &ldquo;I am
free to confess,&rdquo; wrote A. F. Mummery, &ldquo;that I would still
climb, even though there were no scenery to look at.&rdquo; And
Mrs. Aubrey Le Blond echoes this sentiment in a defiant challenge to
their uncomprehending critics. &ldquo;To further confound the
enemy,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;we do not hide the fact that were no
view obtainable from the summit a true climber would still continue to
climb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why do they climb? The motives are many&mdash;the result joy. Yes,
joy, even in the providential escapes and the &ldquo;bad five
minutes,&rdquo; beloved by our naïve scribes of the ice-axe, in the
perils and death which they court for the sake of adventure and
exploration. Sir Martin Conway speaks of the systematic climber as the
man for whom climbing takes the place of fishing and shooting. How
depressingly banal! Yet Sir Martin Conway has written some of the
finest tributes to the glories of the Alps, and has shown himself a
master of artistic interpretation of their
<!-- Page 42 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
wealth of beauty. Whymper excels in matter-of-fact history of climbs,
yet there is an undercurrent of reverence for the mysteries of
Nature's beauty.</p>

<p>The expert cragsman climbs to attain acrobatic efficiency, and may
aim at nothing higher than inspired legs. Mrs. Peck climbed to
establish the equality of the sexes. Mr. and Mrs. Bullock Workman
climbed in the Himalayas with strong determination to name a mountain
Mount Bullock Workman. They did, and the mountain, which attains
19,450 feet, is none the worse. Climbers are exceedingly human in
their love of getting to the top before fellow-climbers. Here they
follow the ordinary rules for human conduct in commerce, politics, and
literature. There have been some loud and unseemly quarrels as to
honours and fame attendant on the first successful conquest of a
desirable peak. It has been generally held that if you cannot get a
mountain to yourself you can at any rate devise a new route. But I
cannot bring myself to speak harshly of such failings. The utmost I
will say is that it were better if such enthusiasm were tempered with
a little humour.</p>

<p>Mark Twain saw through that deadly seriousness
<!-- Page 43 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
of the pure climber. He saw the fatuity of mere peak-hunting. It
impressed him strongly even on the Rigi-Kulm. &ldquo;We climbed and
climbed,&rdquo; he writes in <i>A Tramp Abroad</i>, &ldquo;and we kept
on climbing; we reached about forty summits: there was always another
one just ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the pure climber is always a fountain of delight, even though
he does not see himself as others see him. The pages of Conway,
Mummery, Sir Claud Schuster, and Bruce abound in gems of nature-lore,
ever fresh and ever alluring. As I search for more self-revelation in
my books by mountain-lovers, I find myself observed through the
window. It is only a cow on her way to the hollow tree into which the
water courses out of the earth. But the cow brings me back to the
strenuous Alpine life, and I find myself concluding, as I replace the
books on their shelves, that I do not care why men climb so long as
they climb in spirit and body.</p>

<h2>THE BORDERLAND</h2>

<p>This evening the blind man came up the path from the village. I was
sitting on a stump of pine listening to the merry peal of the bells of
the little village church below. He carried a milk-can, and felt his
way with a long staff, with which he tapped the stones in front of
him. He hesitated for a moment as he passed me, as if vaguely
conscious of a disturbing presence. We have been good friends, the
blind man and I, and have had many a talk on this, our common
path. But to-night I sat silent, wondering. For a message had reached
me that a friend had been killed in battle. A man strong and active in
body, intensely alive and sensitive in soul. One of those whom we can
never think of as dead, so wholly do they belong to life.</p>

<p>The blind man stopped at a little distance. He chose a place where
the trees have been cleared and the snow mountains spread themselves
<!-- Page 45 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
for the feast of the eyes of those who can see. He put his milk-can
and his staff on the ground, and stood for a moment with head bowed as
if crushed by his infirmity. Then he threw up his hands and raised his
head, as though a sudden vision had come to him&mdash;his whole body
tense and expectant, like that of a man who strains every nerve to
catch a message from the hills across the valley. For a minute he
remained still, as if receiving something in his hands borne by the
silence. Then he picked up his staff and his can. He turned round and
faced me for a moment before resuming his journey. There was a smile
on his lips and a strange radiance in his sightless eyes, and I wished
that I, too, might see what he had seen.</p>

<p>For the darkness with which we are afflicted lay heavily around me,
and seemed greater even than the blindness of the eyes. The war has
brought the mystery of death to our hearts with pitiless
insistence. Every bullet that finds its mark kills more than the
soldier who falls. Ties of love and friendship are shattered hour by
hour and day by day, as the guns of war roar out their message of
destruction. We are all partners in a gigantic
<!-- Page 46 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Dance of Death such as Holbein never imagined. To him Death was the
wily and insistent enemy of human activity and hope, a spy watching in
the doorway for an opportunity to snap the thread of life.  We have
cajoled and magnified Death until he has outgrown all natural
proportions; through centuries of war and preparation for war we have
appealed to him to settle our national differences. We have outdone
the earthquake and the cyclone in valid claims upon his power and
presence; we have outwitted pestilence and famine in our efforts to
hold his attention. We, of the twentieth century, have attained
mastery in the art of killing. We kill by fire and bursting shell, we
kill by mine and gas. We dive under the surface of the water to
surprise our enemy, we fly in the air and sow fire and devastation
upon the earth. We have chained science to our chariot of Death, we
have made giant tools of killing which mow down regiments of men at
great distances. We send out fumes of poison which envelop groups of
human beings, killing them gently, and emphasizing the triumph of art
by leaving them in attitudes simulating life. We project shells so
powerful
<!-- Page 47 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
that men disappear in the explosion, melted, disintegrated by its
destructive force.</p>

<p>And when long-distance scientific methods of man-killing fall short
of the passions of the fray or the exigencies of the fight, we return
to the primitive ways of savages, and kill by dagger and knife, by
bayonet and fist. Thus millions of men are slain in this war, which
has achieved superiority over all other wars in history by the number
of its dead and its gigantic destructiveness. And other millions of
men and women are plunged into sorrow and mourning for the dead, and
to them the meaning of life is hidden behind a veil of tears and
blood.</p>

<p>There is an incongruity about death on the battlefield which
assails the mind. The incongruity is there notwithstanding the
probability that the soldier who faces the fire of the enemy will be
killed. It defies the mathematical calculation of chances. It rises
naturally as a protest against the sudden termination of life at its
fullest. Death after a long illness, at the eventide of life, partakes
of the order of falling leaves and autumnal oblivion. It may come
softly as sleep when the day's work is done; it may come mercifully
<!-- Page 48 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
to end bodily pain and wretchedness. There are moments in every life
when the ebb of physical force is so low that death seems but a step
across the border&mdash;a change by which we desire to cure the
weariness of thought. The soldier goes into battle charged with youth
and life, buoyant with energy of muscle and nerve. Death seizes him at
the noontide of life and leaves us blindly groping for other-worldly
compensation.</p>

<p>The present war is being fought against a background of questions
which cannot be suppressed by discipline or the mere fulfilment of
patriotic duty. The old acceptance of the social order is passing
away. The old acceptance of religious nescience is passing away; there
is a new impatience to reach the foundation of things, a popular
clamour for explanation of the riddles of life. Out of the
decivilizing forces of war, its tumult and wreckage, there emerges a
new quest for truth.  Simple souls are troubled with a warlike desire
for evidence of immortality. The parson's exhortations to live by
faith and unreasoning acceptance of ecclesiastical doctrine fall on
inattentive ears. &ldquo;There is a shocking recrudescence of
superstition and devil-worship,&rdquo;
<!-- Page 49 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
said a clergyman to me the other day; &ldquo;people consult fraudulent
mediums and fortune-tellers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I listened to him and remembered an afternoon's visit to a bereaved
mother. She is a charwoman endowed with the scientific mind. Her son
had been killed by an exploding shell. Only a fragment or two had been
necessary for the task. Jimmy had no chance. Courage and energy had
never failed him. The spirit that dwelt within his thin and somewhat
stunted body would have rejoiced in battle with a lion. But shells are
no respecters of spirit. Jimmy had successfully fought poverty and
ill-health; he had risen from a newspaper-boy's existence to the dizzy
heights of a milkman's cart. His pale face with its prominent eyes and
rich, chestnut forelock bore an expression of indomitable Cockney
confidence in the ultimate decency of things. He had always been kind
to his mother. &ldquo;More like a girl than a boy,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;in the way he cared for his home and looked after me.&rdquo;
And now Jimmy was dead: the message had come that he would not
return. &ldquo;And why is he dead,&rdquo; said the mother to me,
&ldquo;and where is he?&rdquo; She
<!-- Page 50 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
was sitting in her kitchen, which bore its usual aspect of order and
cleanliness. But her face looked as if some disordering power had
passed over her. &ldquo;I asked our curate to explain where Jimmy
is,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and he told me that doubt is a sin,
and that we shall meet again on the day of resurrection.  And when I
told him that I felt Jimmy quite close to me in this kitchen, a week
after his death, and that I thought I heard his voice calling me, the
curate said I ought not to think of such things. Faith and hard work
were the best cure for such fancies, he said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But do you know what I did?&rdquo; she added in a whisper,
intended to deceive the curate, &ldquo;I went to one of those mediums
that Mrs. Jones knows about. I paid a shilling, and we all sat in a
ring, and the medium saw Jimmy and described him, just as he is in his
uniform and cap, a little over the right ear, and the scar across his
nose&mdash;you know, the scar from the fall down the front steps when
he was nine&mdash;and all smiling, and showing the missing
tooth. 'Jimmy wants you to know that he is happy, very happy,' she
said, and then Jimmy came and spoke through the medium. 'Mother,' he
said to me, 'I want you to
<!-- Page 51 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
give my pipe with the silver band to Charlie, and don't make no bones
about it.' Then I knew it was Jimmy, for Jimmy always used to say
'don't make no bones about it.' And now I feel he is alive somewhere,
and I shall go again to the medium and find out more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought of this when the clergyman complained of the prevalence
of superstition and visits to mediums. I suggested that he should
investigate the subject of spiritualism and the reasons for its appeal
to sorrow-stricken relatives and friends of soldiers. The suggestion
was indignantly rejected. Religion was to him a theory based on
revelation vouchsafed thousands of years ago; it was now a system of
stereotyped belief and conduct, strangely removed from the
perplexities and anguish of the individual soul. His academic mind
recoiled from the grotesque and trivial messages associated with
séances and the performances of professional psychics.</p>

<p>We are wont to contemplate immortality in much the same manner as
we contemplate the moon. It is something remote and incapable of
active interference in our daily life and tasks. It sheds a pale and
pleasant light on our earthly pilgrimage, and we in our turn
<!-- Page 52 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
render homage to the mellow beauty which it imparts to our poetic
imagination. Only children cry for the moon. We know it is
unattainable.</p>

<p>The rejection of the crude theories of spiritualism is not
altogether the result of wilful blindness. In our innermost minds, in
the region beyond the grasp of the brain and its ready
generalizations, we hunger for inexpressible reality, for life beyond
the stars. We have eaten of the tree of sense-knowledge: we have seen,
heard, felt, tasted. We want a reality above the traffic and deception
of the senses. Vaguely, but insistently we feel the call to the life
of the spirit, and when its definition eludes us, we prefer silence
and faith. It is then that the familiar prattle of the séance-room
offends us. We sought freedom, light, absolution from the trammels of
personality, and we are told that the dead appear in bodies and
clothes, that they toil and fret, that they inhabit houses and
cities. Our plains Elysian suffer an invasion of lawyers and
physicians, of merchants and moneylenders. The weariness of repetition
pursues us.</p>

<p>And yet we may be more completely the victims of illusion than our
vendor of spiritualistic
<!-- Page 53 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
revelation. We who cherish the belief in immortality forget that death
can be naught but the shedding of a form.  The substance is
unchanged. The fabric of the mind is woven day by day by impressions
and ideas, by experience and action. Nobody questions the commonplace
phenomena of the shaping of individuality and character.  Habits,
occupation, tastes, and desires mould a distinct personality out of
the common clay. The experience of death cannot dissolve the
personality. The death-process can neither whitewash a man's sin nor
exalt him beyond his virtue.</p>

<p>And thus it is that he who dearly loved a joke may joke still, and
he who thought he was collecting fine old pictures may still indulge
his taste. Delusions! Not impossible or even unlikely. Kant
demonstrated once for all our complete enslavement by phenomena and
our inability to approach things-in-themselves. Spiritualistic
interpretation of post-mortem conditions offers no
exception. Imagination continues to master our souls. Spiritualism
offends us by offering bread-and-butter when we expect moonshine.</p>

<p>We are loath to part with the belief that
<!-- Page 54 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
death transforms the character by one great stroke of spiritual
lightning. Vanity, envy, meanness, greed, the foibles and frailties of
human nature, repel us when we imagine their persistence in others
after death. We infinitely prefer the thought that they should be
purged and radiant with spiritual effulgence. We are not so sure about
ourselves, for the objective classification of the qualities which go
to form our own character is a difficult achievement. And the idea of
dispensing with essential parts of our mental equipment does not
commend itself to us. There is a point in all our philosophy where
speculation seeks the natural repose of the unknowable. It is quickly
reached when we attempt to probe the mystery of selfhood.</p>

<p>The plain question whether the dead can communicate with the living
persists in spite of the imperfections of the answer. The war has made
it paramount, and only second in importance to the crucial query: Do
they live? There is a clamour for evidence, signs, messages,
testimony.  The human heart cries out for comfort. &ldquo;Yesterday he
breathed the same air, felt and thought as I do. To-day he lies dead,
his body shattered, his hopes
<!-- Page 55 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
wrecked, his happy laughter silent. Does he know? Does he feel and
remember? Is there an eternal gulf of silence between us?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockwide">

<span class="i0">O! for the touch of a vanished hand,</span>

<p>The Church tries vainly to ban the new inquisitiveness. The
intercourse with familiar spirits is condemned as a theological
offence, a vainglorious and futile storming of the citadel of God. The
secret of the tomb must be preserved, though the masses of Christendom
have ceased to believe in the long and mouldering sleep of the
centuries before the summons to the Judgment. They are no longer
scorched by the threat of eternal fire, nor soothed by the hope of
clouds and harps. The love that is in them would not tolerate the
infliction of an eternity of torture on a fellow-soul, and their
conception of the love of God cannot place Him below the promptings of
human mercy. The reason that is in them is not attracted by the
promise of a heaven of rosy inaction and strifeless rest. The contrast
of heaven and hell, so powerful a corrective of human waywardness in
mediæval times, fails
<!-- Page 56 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
to impress the modern mind. The windows of experience and knowledge
have been opened too widely, the powers and manifold possibilities of
the earth lie open and tempt to the search for a super-mundane world,
not poorer and more complex, but richer and more lavish in creative
force.</p>

<p>The law supports the opposition of the Church and frowns on the
practice of mediumship and clairvoyance. The law denies the
possibility of spirit intercourse and forbids the exercise of
supernormal faculties in exploring the untrodden realms of the
future. Prosecutions are instituted under the old Witchcraft and
Vagrancy Acts, and psychic practitioners are fined or sent to prison
in the hope of stemming the tide of inquiry. The law and the spirit
were ever at variance. But it is difficult to understand why those who
mourn, and who ask questions, should be deprived of the comfort which
they may find through visits to professional mediums. The risk of
deception and false pretences is there, it is true, but that risk
exists everywhere. There are lawyers, politicians, and physicians who
tell &ldquo;fortunes&rdquo; and practise &ldquo;witchcraft&rdquo; of
their own brand, decidedly more
<!-- Page 57 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
harmful and disruptive than the visions of the unlettered
clairvoyant.</p>

<p>The magistrate, who sends a clairvoyant to prison because he is
convinced that all claims to psychic gifts and to communion with
discarnate spirits are fraudulent, is not troubled by his ignorance,
and the evidence of psychic research is not acceptable in his
court. He typifies the perpetual official, ever ready to suppress new
and evolutionary thought. After all, psychic science fares no worse
than the physical sciences in the judgment of respectable
mediocrity. The progress of science in the nineteenth century was one
long conquest of territory in the land of the impossible. Inventors
and inventions have met with incredulity and mockery. Railways,
steamships, aeroplanes, telegraphy, telephony and cinematographs have
all emerged from the region of &ldquo;impossibilities.&rdquo;
Röntgen-rays and radium have descended from the sphere of
miracles.</p>

<p>Experience should endow us with cautiousness in proclaiming
impossibilities of the future. The study of psychic science has
imposed no greater strain on my reason than the attempt to explain the
mysteries of biology and astronomy. Observation and classification do
not
<!-- Page 58 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
necessarily imply elucidation. The miracle of the f&oelig;tus taking
human shape and soul, or of the oak rising out of the acorn and the
brown earth is to me as baffling as the materialization of a
spirit. The marvels of the cell-life and the daily chemistry which
maintain the body charm my attention as much as the mysterious clouds
of light with which spirits are wont to signalize their presence in
the séance-room. I have sat for hours on a summer night by the
Mediterranean watching the phosphorescent waves throw a luminous spray
over the shore, and meditating on the inexhaustible fertility of the
sea. And I have watched with the same intense wonder the phenomena of
the soul illuminated by the <i>daimon</i> of inner vision and the
infinite manifestations of the power of spirit over matter. From the
point of view of science there is no clearly defined frontier between
the natural and the supernatural, the commonplace and the
miraculous. All is soil for the plough, all defies our designs for
complete explanation. From the point of view of religious emotion,
there is the greatest possible difference between the sciences of
psychic force and those that seek to probe the mysteries
<!-- Page 59 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
of the physical world. The question of the immortality of the human
soul is infinitely more engrossing than that of the formation of the
skull of neolithic man. The strictly evidential demonstration of
communion between the living and the dead might be almost negligible
in quantity, and yet the importance of one rap from the world of
discarnate spirits, scientifically demonstrated, would outweigh tomes
of theories in physics.</p>

<p>True, those who live in the spirit need no demonstrations provided
by scientific investigators of psychic problems. The mystic
consciousness with its intuition of immortality, its sensitiveness to
the vibration of life on all planes and in all forms <i>knows</i>, and
in knowledge transcends alike the boundaries of religionists and
scientists. The mystic may smile at the labour expended during the
last fifty years on establishing a strictly evidential basis for the
study of transcendental facts. He has conquered the inherited
blindness of our race, and sees spirit not as a supernatural
demonstration, vouchsafed now and then to doubting humanity, but as
the living Presence of which he is joyously a part. He does not fall
into the common error of forgetting that
<!-- Page 60 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
we are spirits sheathed in flesh, but bearing within ourselves the
power over matter which is destined to achieve the miraculous. He can
dispense with a medium, being himself a fountain of light, and
experiencing the wondrous self-illumination of which Thomas Treherne
sang&mdash;</p>

<p>But the spiritual raptures of the mystics of all ages have not

immortality. To them the application of the methods approved by reason

deduction. They know that the great generalizations of
science&mdash;the theories of the indestructibility of matter, of
gravitation, of the conservation of energy&mdash;are but counters of
mind exchanged in default of elusive realities. They know that the
pressure of research has reduced many of the lesser generalizations
and theories to a fluid and amorphous state. &ldquo;Immutable&rdquo;
laws have been turned into faulty conclusions, hastily drawn and
readily abandoned before the advance of new facts. The fixity of the
elements in chemistry, the undulatory movement of light, the stability
of the planetary orbits, the indestructibility of the atom, are all
abstractions which have been subjected to the reforming processes of
new thought.</p>

<p>Progress in physics has been marked by bold hypotheses dealing with
imponderable forces, and by experiments disclosing hidden properties
of matter. The hypothetical ether has been as fruitful in the
liberation of thought as the demonstration of the existence of the
X-rays.</p>

<p>The application of methods of scientific accuracy to the physical
phenomena of spiritualism
<!-- Page 62 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
involves no revolution in mental processes or reversal of the laws of
logic. The publication of the results of the classical experiments in
materialization undertaken in 1874 by Sir William Crookes with the
medium Florence Cooke caused incredulous amazement, for the simple
reason that the custodians of science had not applied themselves to
the lessons afforded by the continuous shifting of their
frontiers. Crookes' report that Katie King, the spirit who took
material form during the séances, was a perfect, though mysterious
replica of the natural-born human being, roused no general scientific
interest. He asserted that Katie was physiologically complete. That
she walked, talked, expressed intelligence and feeling, that she had a
regularly beating heart and sound lungs. He further pointed out that
the personality of Katie in appearance and character differed
considerably from that of the medium, and that it was impossible to
regard the materialized form as but a phantasm of the living. A
stupendous discovery or a pitiful figment of a lunatic brain! But no
flash of lightning rent the halls of learning; Sir William Crookes'
researches into radiant matter could safely be accepted as workable
<!-- Page 63 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
intellectual ground, but not his researches into spiritual
dynamics.</p>

<p>And yet there was no unorthodoxy in his methods of research; he
imposed strict conditions of experimental control. There is a strange
reluctance in accepting the necessity for &ldquo;mediums&rdquo; in
psychic manifestations. If these things are possible, we are told, why
not here, now, anywhere, in broad daylight? Why mystifying circles,
cabinets, and subdued light? Our scoffers forget that scientific
investigation always requires a medium and method. The need of the
telescope and the microscope is not questioned, but the thought of the
planchette evokes ridicule. The practical success of wireless
telegraphy depends on the use of an adequate medium for the
transmission of electricity. The most meagre training suffices to
prevent the declaration that if wireless messages cannot be sent
without apparatus they cannot be sent at all.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the indifference of the majority of scientists, the
problems of spirit intercourse have proved sufficiently attractive to
stimulate a vast amount of experimentation and theorizing. The study
of mediumship has necessarily become the study of consciousness
<!-- Page 64 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
and the occult powers of the human mind. In the centre a handful of
fearless scientists: Crookes, Wallace, Richet, Flammarion, Morselli,
Baraduc, Myers, Lombroso, Lodge, and Barrett; in the inner circle a
number of academic investigators, disdaining alike the premature
proclamation of phenomenal results and the obstinate denial of facts;
in the outer circle an ever-growing mass of souls clamouring for the
crumbs of evidence, hungry for something personal and soul-warming in
our dealings with the Divine dispensation.</p>

<p>The annals of psychic science&mdash;in different tongues and of
different continents&mdash;are largely devoted to the investigation of
trance, clairvoyance, clairaudience, telepathy, hypnotism, dreams,
premonitions, automatic writing, visions, and messages from the dying,
multiple personality, and all the phenomena associated with the
subconscious self. Many students have dispensed with the spirit
hypothesis as an unnecessary and embarrassing complication in a
subject already overburdened with difficulties. Spirit messages are to
them examples of the activity of the subliminal self, and a medium is
a person gifted&mdash;or cursed&mdash;with extraordinary subconscious
force and
<!-- Page 65 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
lucidity.  Materializations, they argue, are produced through the
effluvia of the living and controlled by the subliminal forces of the
participators in the séance. Spirits are nothing but
thought-forms. The painstaking investigation recorded in the
<i>Proceedings</i> and <i>Journal of the Society for Psychical
Research</i> has to a great extent been carried on by inquirers
unencumbered by any bias towards &ldquo;spookery.&rdquo; But the
theories in elaboration of psycho-pathological vagaries and
dissociation of personality which have been substituted for the spirit
hypothesis certainly do not err on the side of intelligible
explication. They have but deepened the mystery and show the vista of
new and unexplored paths in psychic science.</p>

<p>Others, again, who are not unwilling to believe that the phenomena
are produced by the action of intelligences other than that of the
medium, abandon further study because of the meagreness of the
intellectual results. They have waited on the visitors from another
world, notebook in hand, plying them with careful questions intended
to increase our modest store of knowledge. The replies were
unsatisfactory, commonplace, sometimes ludicrous. Attempts to write a
passable textbook
<!-- Page 66 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
on life in the spirit world have failed lamentably. The indignation of
the sorely disappointed scientist was voiced by the late Professor
Hugo Münsterberg, of Harvard, in his <i>Psychology of Life</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Thousands and thousands of spirits have
appeared; the ghosts of the greatest men have said their say, and yet
the substance of it has always been the absurdest silliness. Not one
inspiring thought has yet been transmitted by this mystical way; only
the most vulgar trivialities. It has never helped to find the truth;
it has never brought forth anything but nervous fear and
superstition.</p></div>

<p>His denunciation embraces the whole subject of spiritualistic
evidence and ends in utter pessimism&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Our belief in immortality must rest on the
gossip which departed spirits utter in dark rooms through the mouths
of hypnotized business mediums, and our deepest personality comes to
light when we scribble disconnected phrases in automatic writing. Is
life then really still worth living?</p></div>

<p>I have every sympathy with the complaint. But our psychologist
forgot that life is largely made up of trivialities, and that the
spirits of the dead, if they really wish to make themselves known to
us, can do so with greater
<!-- Page 67 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
certainty of being recognized by reminding us of events and objects
with which they are associated in our memory than by presenting us
with a corrected version of the nebular theory. The average medium and
the average gathering of inquirers are not distinguished by any great
intellectual achievement. The general educational level may be low and
the total capacity to sift and weigh evidence may fall short of that
of an undergraduates' debating society.  Yet the evidence produced may
not only be entirely soul-satisfying to the participants, but
perfectly acceptable to a critic contented with the average quality of
evidence current in a court of law. It may even be true that the
evidential value rises with the number of trivialities recorded.</p>

<p>And &ldquo;the truth&rdquo; which Professor Münsterberg sought in
vain is demonstrated to others through the same trivial evidence, as
is shown by the verdict of Alfred Russel Wallace:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Spiritualism demonstrates by direct
evidence, as conclusive as the nature of the case admits, that the
so-called dead are still alive; that our friends are often with us,
though unseen, and give direct proof of a future life&mdash;proof
which so many crave, but for want of which so many live and die in
anxious doubt. How valuable the certainty to be gained from
<!-- Page 68 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
spiritual communications! A clergyman, a friend of mine, who witnessed
the phenomena, and who before was in a state of the greatest
depression, caused by the death of his son, said to me, &ldquo;I am
now full of confidence and cheerfulness. I am a changed
man.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It is not unnatural that the answers given to those who ask for
admittance to the closed door of the mysteries of the human soul
should be pitched in the same key as the inquiry. Disappointment is
not uncommon. I have taken part in séances of every kind, with
cautious investigators devoid of all spiritualistic bias, with
unsophisticated believers in a supernatural source of all psychic
phenomena, with scoffers convinced that every medium is an impostor,
and that nothing but a little common sense is needed for the
exposure. The results have been largely dependent on the mentality of
the investigators. Failure to understand this is responsible for much
of the disappointment and contempt with which otherwise intelligent
critics have dismissed the subject. The accumulated thought-power, the
collective mind of those who participate, profoundly influence the
medium and the quality of the communications received.
<!-- Page 69 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
One stubborn soul may wreck the meeting. I remember an evening at the
house of Mr. W. T. Stead. There had been a series of highly successful
demonstrations of &ldquo;spirit voices,&rdquo; distinctly audible and
perfectly intelligible. A well-known minister of the Church visible
joined the circle&mdash;a man clothed in all the outward signs of
spirituality, uniting clerical decorum with an emotional fervour in
preaching which had made him a popular favourite. Though feeling has
now and then led him into unconventional paths of theological thought,
fate has surely marked him for the adornment of a bishopric. He came
to study the alleged powers of the medium. He doubted everything and
everybody. The easy faith and unquestioning acceptance of miraculous
events of which he was not ashamed whilst in the pulpit had now been
exchanged for vigilant suspicion and impatient analysis. He plied the
medium with questions, bludgeoned her with requests for evidence that
she was not deluded or deluding. He turned himself into
cross-examining counsel, proud of his discrimination and his immunity
against the insidious appeal of the supernatural. He succeeded. The
medium was confounded, she
<!-- Page 70 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
lost her power; the phenomena did not occur.  The atmosphere was
chilled. Some of us felt we would rather have been visited by the
village blacksmith than by this priestly exponent of sweet-faced
materialism.</p>

<p>I do not deny that I have often been struck with the intellectual
poverty of messages from the spirit world. They are often silly, and
not seldom untruthful. The silliness and the untruthfulness are
faithful reflections of common human failings, and only show that
heavenly wisdom is as unattainable through the average spiritualistic
channels as it is in the Houses of Parliament or the courts of
law.</p>

<p>I can imagine a radiant and purely spiritual being attempting to
convey a true description of the state of spiritual bliss to a circle
of men and women representative of cultured thought, and practical
efficiency in the affairs of the world. Let the circle include a few
university professors, some successful men of business, a couple of
judges, a sprinkling of journalists, an archdeacon or two, and some
authors of repute. Let them all be actuated by a strong desire to
obtain reliable information and to give a fair and unprejudiced
hearing to the visitor.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 71 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
</div>

<p>The visitor is necessarily hampered by the necessity for a
medium. It may be that the senior judge is gifted with psychic powers
and that the method of communication chosen is that of trance.</p>

<p>The learned brain-cells would transmit the message up to a certain
point, but when an effort was made to depict unfathomed depths and
heights of transcendental experience, the judicial mind would rebel.
The sense of logic would be strained. The conception of the possible
would be violated. A fearful consciousness of being guilty of uttering
lies would persist, in spite of efforts to subdue reason. Language
would break in the attempt to find words for the inexpressible, the
message would be blurred and incoherent. The judge might pull himself
together, feeling that the turbulent thought-waves of contending
counsel form a much safer ground on which to pronounce truth than the
fourth-dimensional hurricane with which he had just battled. And the
audience might turn with relief to the thought of dinner outside
Bedlam.</p>

<p>By some wild flights of imagination we may picture another kind of
circle. Let a poet be the medium; Swedenborg, Dante, Blake,
<!-- Page 72 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Socrates, Jacob Böhme, Tasso, Milton, Eckart, Ruysbroek, St. Teresa,
Joan of Arc, Emerson, Shelley, and a few more visionaries, and
dreamers be of the circle. Let our Radiant Being try again. The
vibrations of the combined psychic force would respond more readily to
the world-strangeness of the visitor. There would be fewer mental
obstacles raised by the sense of the impossible. The restraints of
logic would be more easily overcome.  The avenues of supersensual
impressions would be open. The medium would transmit the message to a
point far beyond that possible to our psychic judge, and the audience
would encourage him by their readiness to grasp the revelations
made. The language of mysticism, philosophy, and poetry would be
strained to its utmost capacity. Then a sense of incompleteness, of
deficiency, of hopeless relativity would overcome the audience. The
medium had exerted every spiritual faculty to receive the truth. But
the visitor could not convey celestial realities to terrene minds.</p>

<p>Every true artist in words, or colour, or sound is always haunted
by the inexpressible&mdash;by spiritual impotence to overcome the laws
of imprisonment in the flesh. He clutches
<!-- Page 73 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
at symbol and suggestion, at parable and fable, conscious of the truth
that the unreal is the most real.</p>

<p>The goats have gathered round me as I sit musing in the
gloaming. The leading goat is a handsome animal, generally respected
and feared by the rest of the herd. He has excellent knowledge,
inherited and acquired, of the uses of mountains, and his venerable
beard adorns a head of undisputed male ascendancy in the tribe. I bear
him a grudge. He is in the habit of eating my sapling pines, carefully
planted by me and carelessly nipped in the bud by him. I have
expostulated with him in a variety of ways&mdash;some gentle, others
forceful, but he is incorrigible.  He will not understand that my
young pines are beautiful, and that they are expected to grow into
fine trees. He has no sense of beauty, of symmetry, of fitness. He is
only a beast. He has no soul&mdash;I pause, remembering the
ineffectual attempts of my Radiant Being to inspire human souls with a
greater vision. Are we not all goats before the gaze of more finely
organized creatures?</p>

<p>The evolutionist need not be disheartened by the thought. Nature is
unexhausted. Desire
<!-- Page 74 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
and experience are ever creating new forms, new organs. A child's book
of beasts will supply the requisite suggestion: the neck of the
giraffe, the stripes of the tiger, the tail of the beaver may, without
offence, provide analogies for the faith in organic human
perfectibility. The processes of natural selection and variation
cannot have been brought to a standstill; they must be at work now and
may yet&mdash;should surroundings and necessity create the
demand&mdash;halve the neck of the giraffe, give snow-white lamb's
clothing to the tiger, and turn the rudder of the beaver into the
prehensile tail of the monkey.  There is no biological completion, no
finitude. It is only a matter of time&mdash;sufficient time&mdash;and
our bodies may become as strangely interesting to posterity as are to
us the dinosaurs and mammoths of the remote past.</p>

<p>Mind is not arrested by formal obstacles. It builds, destroys, and
rebuilds. It may take a million years to fashion a useful organ.
Slowness is no deterrent. The powers that shaped the genius of
Michelangelo and Shakespeare out of the rude brain of savage man
needed time, but the achievement was worthy of the labour. To-day
there are signs and
<!-- Page 75 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
portents that psychic faculties once possessed by the very few are in
process of development in the many, that new senses are awakened which
will find contact with realities hitherto unperceived.  The
imperfections of mediumship and the remoteness of a psychic
super-humanity, godlike in wisdom and ethereal in constitution, do not
conceal the trend of mental evolution. The medium is often a strange
blend of spiritual and carnal tendencies, of knowledge and ignorance,
of delicate perception and denseness. Those who expect saintliness as
the first attribute of psychic advancement will certainly be
disillusioned.  These gifts and graces may appear, not only without
any corresponding degree of culture and learning, but associated with
a certain vulgarity of thought and conduct. The psychic is essentially
impressionable, liable to mental contagion, easily stirred by
suggestion. The tendency to instability, to emotional excess, is part
of this receptivity which culminates in the state of being
&ldquo;controlled.&rdquo; An untrained psychic who is mastered by his
impressions, instead of being their master, may easily be induced to
tell lies and give false messages by a visitor who is determined to
<!-- Page 76 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
discover fraud. The same psychic may rise to unaccustomed levels of
spiritual clearsight in the presence of a visitor who demands the
truth only.</p>

<p>The ladder of psychic development is long and arduous to mount. The
number of the climbers steadily diminishes as the top is
reached. Here, as elsewhere, there is a common crowd, content with the
steps nearest the earth, in morals a faithful reflection of average
humanity. They are neither better nor worse, they are merely
different. They are the masons of the mind, a race of builders,
addicted to a workmanship of their own.</p>

<p>To a discerning psychologist they are profoundly interesting,
heralds of a new race and a new age; to an unsophisticated alienist
they are merely insane, dangerous victims of sick brains. The whole
fabric of evidence relating to lunacy would be broken up by the
admission that these strange people who fall into trance and speak
unknown tongues or convey messages from the dead are sane. Current
theories of psycho-pathology would be hopelessly disturbed by the
admission that there may be a super-sanity in which clairvoyance and
clairaudience are normal and
<!-- Page 77 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
healthy manifestations of life. A person who professes to be an
exponent of psychometry, who recalls circumstances and events from the
&ldquo;aura&rdquo; of inanimate objects, such as a letter or a glove,
is naturally classed with the insane. Hallucinations <i>en masse</i>
are proffered as explanation of the physical phenomena which take
place. Thus only can orthodox psychiatry remain unperturbed when heavy
objects are lifted without any apparent cause, when unearthly sounds
and voices are produced, when human forms take shape, are seen, and
disappear.</p>

<p>The study of psychic faculties is above all a study of
consciousness.  Maeterlinck speaks of &ldquo;the gravest problem that
can thrill mankind, the knowledge of the future.&rdquo; The knowledge
of the present, of the hidden powers and graces within our souls, is
even more thrilling. I can imagine no science of greater importance,
no investigation more worthy of devotion. The profundity of the
problems is but an incitement. We have not hesitated to tabulate the
stars, to weave precious conjectures as to their courses and
destinies. Is the human soul more remote and inscrutable? We are
assured that it has five windows and
<!-- Page 78 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
no more, that it is useless to look for others. But when an increasing
number of explorers in the house of life tell us that there are six or
seven or more, we may at any rate listen and follow their directions.
Obscurantism is revelling in proclaiming prohibited areas of
investigation.</p>

<p>I recognize that the problem is complicated by the mixture of truth
and falsehood, of genuine psychic powers and counterfeit
practices. There are impostors and parasites who by dint of glib
tongues and nimble wit deceive the foolish and the
credulous. Browning's Sludge is not entirely extinct. Honest workers
who turn their gifts to professional uses and who depend on the
patronage of the public are subject to peculiar temptations. They are
visited by the worldly and the covetous, they are exploited by
sensation-mongers and fraud-hunters, they are subjected to conditions
entirely inimical to spiritual poise and lucidity. Some resort to
fraud. The report that the medium failed to satisfy the client is apt
to interfere with business, and failure is, therefore, shunned.  But
the law does not trouble to distinguish between the honest and the
dishonest person who claims psychic gifts. From
<!-- Page 79 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
the legal point of view it is all pretence. It is imperatively
necessary that genuine psychic gifts should be protected from the
depredations of frivolity as well as from the interference of an
obsolete law. We have some idea of protecting great and uncommon gifts
in music, mathematics, and poetry, but we leave psychic gifts without
help or training. An institute for the study of Psychic Science in all
its branches, with facilities for training and assisting individual
gifts, would remove some of the worst features of the present
system. A genuine psychic should be the holder of some form of
certificate or licence entitling him to use his gifts for the benefit
of others.</p>

<p>Of course, the subject bristles with difficulties, but I do not see
that they are more insuperable than those which presented themselves
when first the idea of registering and licensing the medical and legal
professions presented itself. And those who are indignant at the
thought of the clairvoyant charging a fee may profitably reflect on
the general assumption that the labourer is worthy of his hire. The
deans and bishops who discourse so eloquently on the sins of the
necromancers are not, I believe, renouncing the material
<!-- Page 80 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
benefits and emoluments of their priestly calling.</p>

<p>I do not look to visits to professional mediums for initiation into
the higher mysteries of the human spirit. They may show the
casket&mdash;precious as an indication of the contents, but of little
value to those who are bent on finding the jewel within. And I agree
that no advanced soul is &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; by a discarnate
spirit, but rises through aspiration and self-restraint to union with
higher intelligences. I can see no light or love in the attitude of
those professors of Christianity who denounce all spiritualistic
tendencies as anti-Christian. It seems to me that the whole Christian
faith is spiritualistic in the widest sense of the word.  The Old and
the New Testaments are permeated with the belief in the reality of
communication between the living and the dead. The injunction in the
Old Testament against sorcerers and wizards was intended to check
tendencies to unreasonable and dangerous superstition.</p>

<p>Moses may have had excellent reasons for forbidding occult
practices amongst the Jews. Saul, who had put away those that had
familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land, was
<!-- Page 81 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
not unlike some modern adversaries of spiritualism when in the day of
his trouble and fear he consulted the medium of Endor. The accepted
prophets of Israel were, after all, typical of mediumship. &ldquo;And
the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy
with them, and shalt be turned into another man.&rdquo; They practised
bold fortune-telling in matters large and small, national and
cosmic. To-day they would surely be imprisoned as rogues and vagabonds
under the Vagrancy Act. The New Testament contains no direct
prohibition of the use of psychic powers and many stories of dreams,
visions, and premonitions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same
Spirit,&rdquo; wrote St.  Paul in the First Epistle to the
Corinthians. &ldquo;For to one is given, by the Spirit, the word of
wisdom; to another the word of knowledge, by the same Spirit.... To
another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another
discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another
the interpretation of tongues.... And God hath set some in the Church;
first, apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that
miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
<!-- Page 82 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
governments, diversities of tongues.&rdquo; The praises of charity and
prophecy are sung by the Apostle&mdash;a strange combination in
harmony to those who now seek to separate the Christian faith from its
supernatural origins. Christianity exhorts us not to believe every
spirit, but to &ldquo;try the spirits whether they are of God,&rdquo;
whilst the ecclesiastic bids us chase away the spirits, which he
assumes to be of Satan.</p>

<p>The dull materialism which smothers all signs of independent
spiritual experience is the negation of all the forces which animated
the Master.  The earthly life of Christ, with its supernatural
manifestations, its miracles, and its wonders, was the supreme
demonstration of the spiritualistic conception of the power of
transcending matter. The appearance of Moses and Elias on the Mount of
Transfiguration, whether regarded as a vision or as a materialization,
was of the order of the phenomena which are now banned as
anti-Christian.</p>

<p>No; those who, having wandered in the darkness of death and
blindness, find a ray of light within their own being need not fear
the judgment of the Mediator. Here in the
<!-- Page 83 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
freedom of the mountains I feel something of the inscrutable
certainty, the joy of a secret conviction, that wisdom waits on our
tortuous paths in the Borderland.</p>

<h2>REFORMERS</h2>

<p>Of all generalizations&mdash;false and semi-false&mdash;the one
dividing human beings into those who are content with the world as it
is and those who wish to reform it is the most comforting to me. No
division of sheep and goats was ever more blatantly simple. Some are
born dull-witted, conservative, insensitive, unimaginative&mdash;they
cling passive to the old planet, content to be whirled round in the
purposeless dance of the heavenly bodies. Others are chronic sufferers
from divine discontent&mdash;they open their eyes with critical
intent, they are always conscious of the oblique, the unrighteous, the
worthless in their surroundings. They have a sense of power, a will to
change things. To them the world is a lump of dough, to be shaped and
trimmed into good, serviceable bread.</p>

<p>I know the division is unreal and that reformatory ardour in one
direction is not seldom combined with flint-hearted indifference in
another. But the proposition is good and
<!-- Page 85 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
sufficient for everyday purposes, and acts as an admirable stimulus in
the Camp of the Challengers.</p>

<p>Who can deny that reformers are more interesting than preservers?
They vibrate with life and creative energy, they defy impossibilities,
they carry enthusiasm aloft on their banners of assault on the
existing order of things. Our preservers seem tame and stale
indeed. They hobble about the borders of the well-cultivated garden of
custom and propriety, they find admirable shelter against the fierce
winds of revolt in the offices of bureaucracy. Officialdom is their
divinity and respectability their key to life. They may be
necessary&mdash;as buffers&mdash;but they depress us by their
dulness.</p>

<p>Reformers can be dull too, but they are redeemed by the homage
which they pay to spiritual adventures. They are narrow-minded, but
their narrow-mindedness is relieved by intensity of purpose. They are
not seldom aggressive, argumentative, unpleasant, but they refresh the
dry world by being thoroughly alive. It seems, indeed, as if life were
only made tolerable through the ferment of the desire to reform. Even

pools of the human soul are sometimes stirred by the breeze of
change. We all hope, we all look forward, we all grope for a future
which will be better than the present. In some the hope is firmly
rooted to earth and man-made conventions, in others it soars to
other-worldly perfection.</p>

<p>The world teems with causes and movements that rouse the
imagination and press human lives into the service of the future. The
genesis and development of causes show similar features wherever and
whenever they appear. A soul is astir with an idea, a resentment, a
call for change.  Others heed the message, respond to the cry for
action, feel that this idea, this one idea, is the most important in
the world. Societies and leagues are formed, opposition is
encountered, and the leader becomes sanctified through abuse and
resentment. The idea is embraced by hundreds and thousands; it becomes
a doctrine, a creed, a mental atmosphere in which men live and have
their being. Fierce battles take place between the adherents of the
idea and the opponents. Blind prejudice and hatred are
encountered. Martyrs are made. The crusade is hallowed by suffering
and sacrifice.
<!-- Page 87 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
It becomes an impelling spiritual necessity, an expression of
religion. Gradually the forces of the opposition are
weakened. Concessions and compromises are offered. There are signs of
the contagiousness of the idea even in the house of the
adversaries. The triumph comes with time, and the turbulent waves of
controversy recede into gentle ripples of approval. And for many a
cause for which men have suffered and died, posterity has but a
yawn. &ldquo;Just think of it&mdash;all that fuss and all that turmoil
over something so obvious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seen superficially, this is a fairly accurate account of the fate
of movements for the reform of some glaring injustice, some hoary
cruelty of the past. But is it true? Is the world slowly but surely
getting better&mdash;are the monsters of ignorance and tyranny slain
one by one by our great reformers and laid to rest for ever in a grave
of ignominy? We accept the axiom that slavery has been abolished. Of
all causes that commanded devotion, struggle, persistency, the
anti-slavery movement stands forth as a moral protest of supreme
import. Wilberforce and Lincoln, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Clarkson
fought for a principle which may well be regarded as the very soul of
<!-- Page 88 -->

civilization. The Civil War brought the ideals of human rights and
equality into bloody conflict with the forces of oppression and
commercial exploitation. The new
consciousness<!--Typo: consciousnees--> of human fellowship made white
men lay down their lives for the freedom of black men. A worthy cause,
a sublime offering, a task to which we would like to say &ldquo;Done,
done, once and for all time!&rdquo; But is it done?  Slavery is not
only inherent in every savage and barbaric race, it is not only
paramount in the mind of the Arab trader. Once the social bulwark of
the ancient civilizations of Babylon, Egypt, and India, of Greece and
Rome, it persisted in Europe throughout the Middle Ages, and survived
as serfdom of one kind or another through centuries of advancing
culture. The desire for power over fellow-beings, for opportunities to
control their lives and exploit their labour, is apparently
irradicable. Slavery is still amongst us in a hundred forms and under
new names. All military conquest involves the ancient practices of
serfdom. The conquered nations become slaves of the invader; by
obedience they live, by disobedience they die. The persistence of
slavery seems, then, to be a demonstration
<!-- Page 89 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
of the unchangeability of human nature and of the ultimate
hopelessness of idealist causes. In every reform accomplished the
practical application is local, transitory, dependent on racial and
geographical conditions.  There is obviously a great change in our
penal methods. We do not mutilate our criminals or scalp them for the
preservation of their souls, and we have lost confidence in the rack
and the thumb-screw. But we need only transport ourselves to other
lands and study other people's views of judicial necessities, and we
shall find that the punitive systems of the thirteenth or the
eighteenth centuries are still with us.  Theoretically the blood of
the black and the white man is of the same good quality, and yet very
little provocation is needed for the outbreak of race riots. Negroes
and negresses who have given offence to white people need harbour no
illusions concerning the restraining influences of our Western
civilization.</p>

<p>Like a mountain in eruption the war has thrown up the sordid
passions, the hidden reserves of destructive hate and cruelty in our
common human soul. In war all things are permissible. To murder, to
maim, to
<!-- Page 90 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
destroy, to deceive, to make hideous waste of fertile land, to cause
weeping and wailing amongst the innocent&mdash;these are the
necessities of warfare. They are the commonplace incidents of
war. There are others. It brings to the surface strata of human nature
to which culture has never descended. It explodes our humanitarian
theories by a series of well-directed mines. The ancient horrors of
devices for the punishment of the enemy are feeble competitors with
our modern inventions. Our poison gas, our burning oil, our metallic
monsters that spit death on the enemy and crush his fine defences, our
flying bomb-throwers, all show that we have not as yet succumbed to
humanitarian or Christian ethics. There have been some startling
illustrations of the folly of assuming that we have safely and
irrevocably traversed certain stages of human indifference. We
shuddered at the revelations which called Florence Nightingale to the
Crimea; we now shudder at the heartless carelessness revealed by
Commissions and Reports. The triumph of Red Cross organization, the
mass of charitable and voluntary effort to relieve suffering, the
heroism and splendour of individual sacrifice, soften, but do not
reverse,
<!-- Page 91 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
the impression of a general humanitarian débâcle.</p>

<p>We may, of course, take shelter behind the jejune explanation that
there are two worlds with two moralities. One is war and the other is
peace.  We may affectionately survey the hospitals and orphanages, the
institutions for the blind and the mute, the asylums and the charities
with which each belligerent country pays tribute to the virtues of the
merciful life. Whatever we do, we cannot dispel the darkness by a
frenzied denunciation of war. The monster is not outside ourselves; it
is created and sustained by the hardness of our hearts and the
obtuseness of our brains. The responsibility is ours in war as well as
in peace. Reformers of all ages have battled with the wickedness of
the world, they have stormed stronghold after stronghold of social
iniquity.  Their failures are no less conspicuous than their
successes. Human nature is infinitely pliable and infinitely
resistant.</p><!--Typo: resistent-->

<p>Is it, then, all a matter of change and recurrence? Do culture and
morality grow like flowers in a garden, obedient to the will and taste
of the gardener, but destined to fade and die with the turn of the
season? Do not
<!-- Page 92 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
the civilizations of the past with their perfection of knowledge and
art mock our faith in the permanency of human achievement?  Babylon
and Egypt, Athens and Rome carried the seed of corruption within their
husk of glory. They had elaborate systems of social organization, of
laws, of elucidation of the mysteries of life. They saw beauty and
pursued it, in colour and sound, by word and chisel. The gods were
kind to them, and now and then dispensed with altar and temple. Divine
presences revealed themselves in brook and cornfield, on mountain-tops
and in the faces of animals. Reformers of all kinds were amongst them:
men of the sword with dreams of Empire and conquest for the good of
the nation, priests who demanded sacrifice in the name of a god,
orators who by skilful laying of words taught the art of philosophic
calm. Problems faced them, social iniquities troubled them; they
grappled with morals and strove to build up a better and happier
future.</p>

<p>I was sinking into a reverie over the fall of Babylon and the
problems of recurrence when Marie-Joseph arrived. Marie-Joseph is my
oldest and dearest peasant friend. She
<!-- Page 93 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
is over seventy and devoted to hard work.  Her face is rosy and
wrinkled, and when she laughs it becomes a mass of merry furrows. Her
body gives one the impression of an animated board.  It is strikingly
flat and stiff, and proudly erect. She works in the fields and tends
the cows, and when she bends down to hoe the potatoes or cut the
grass, she just folds herself in two. The stiff straight back in the
neat black dress is different from all the other toiling backs on the
slopes. When I look down from the mountain-tops to the pastures and
plots below, I can always distinguish the back of Marie-Joseph from
the others. To-day she brought me a present of milk and potatoes, and
we sat down to chat over a cup of coffee&mdash;nay, four cups of
coffee, for Marie-Joseph has no cranky ideas about abstinence from
food and drink, and I must, perforce, pretend I have none. I love her
and her ways, though she always manages to disturb me when I wish to
work or think.  Writing and thinking are not work to Marie-Joseph. She
is wholly innocent of the former dissipation and carries out the
latter function without any trouble or fuss. She is, therefore,
justified in disposing of my painful
<!-- Page 94 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
efforts with a contemptuous shrug of her wooden shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marie-Joseph,&rdquo; I said cautiously, when I had watched
the third cup of coffee disappear, and duly discussed butter and
cheese, wine and cows, &ldquo;do you think the world is getting
better?&rdquo; She was slicing a chunk of bread with her capacious
pocket-knife, and stopped short. Her small bright blue eyes peered at
me curiously. &ldquo;I mean, do you believe there is real
progress&mdash;that we are better than we used to be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The knife came dancing down on the plate. &ldquo;Better?&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;not at all; we are worse. Why, when I was young we used
constantly to have processions and carry le Bon Dieu, and I tell you
the harvest was different from what it is now. And the young girls
were modest then; they all wore aprons, and our curé used to insist on
them wearing aprons, for, said he, all women should wear
aprons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All women should wear aprons,&rdquo; I repeated
mechanically, as my thoughts flitted back to Babylon.</p>

<p>Marie-Joseph saw and misinterpreted my disappointment. &ldquo;Did
you grasp what I
<!-- Page 95 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
said?&rdquo; she asked; &ldquo;there is no modesty nowadays. And you
people who come from England,&rdquo; she added sternly, &ldquo;with
your short skirts and your peculiar ways, don't improve
matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt duly rebuked, and during the rest of the hour which Marie-Joseph
wasted on me, I sought to re-establish myself in her opinion by
discoursing on the merits of <i>soupe au fromage</i>.</p>

<p>We all have our chosen test of moral worth, and perhaps our
judgment of the decline and rise of social virtue is as easily swayed
by personal predilection as was that of Marie-Joseph. To me the
persistence of the same cruel and stupid customs throughout the
centuries is a source of perplexed pessimism. I cannot brush aside the
problem by a facile reference to reincarnation. If John the brigand
was a cut-throat and a robber in his twentieth appearance on this
planet, why should he persist in these idiosyncrasies in his
twenty-third return as George the politician and successful captain of
industry? This is not at all a fair representation of the theory of
reincarnation, I shall be told. It is not, but it is one of those to
which we are
<!-- Page 96 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
driven in the desperation of impatience. A friend of mine, a high
authority on matters theosophical, knows of a potent explanation and
anodyne for moral impatience. Humanity, he tells me, is always being
recruited from Mars.  Mars, in spite of its canals, is a low and
wicked planet, with a reptilian population. When the Martians advance
a little beyond the moral status of their fellow-creatures and close
their bloodthirsty eyes in death, their spirits are wafted to our
planet, there to take on new garments of flesh. The influx of brutal
souls is perennial. This explains why, Churches and missionary effort
notwithstanding, we have always savages, cannibals, and barbarians
(and Prussian militarists?)  with us. But there is comfort in the
other side of the picture. When we in our turn have learnt all the
lessons of this miserable globe of folly, when we have mastered all
the virtues and shed all the vices, when we long to be free from the
trammels of sense and appetite and sickness and ambition, we are
transferred to Mercury. Mercury is a highly evolved planet, a
spiritualized existence, free from the obsessions of sex and greed, an
abode of love and freedom.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 97 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
</div>

<p>Oh, how I sigh for Mercury!</p>

<p>Supposing this sinful earth is only a school for reformed Martians;
supposing human nature and history always repeat themselves, and the
end is as the beginning and the beginning as the end? The first steps
in education accomplished, the scholars would be removed to better
premises, and to a more advanced course of instruction. But the old
school would receive new pupils and go on in the same humdrum
way. There would be the same harsh teachers, the same ignorance and
obstinacy, the same punishment and suffering. The worst of it is that
Mercury does not seem exempt from the general curse of nothingness
which seems to brood over all physical existence. There is no
stability even in solar systems. Even we puny creatures can divine
something of their birth and death. Out of whirling nebulæ suns and
planets are born; souls slowly evolve on worlds which were once balls
of fire. There are endless diversity and specialization, myriads of
creatures rise out of the furnace of life. Some gain ascendancy and
lay claim to mental supremacy, to science and religion and the
overlordship of the universe. I am sure
<!-- Page 98 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Mars, Mercury, and Tellus are equally prone to this weakness. One
day&mdash;in the uncountably many of solar mornings&mdash;there is a
collision, a breaking up of all the old forms through contact with
some mysterious roving mass of burning matter. The planets with their
kings and prophets disappear in fire and gas, The perturbation in the
vast Cosmos of Change is probably not greater than that caused by the
fall of an old and rotten tree before the cleansing winds of
spring.</p>

<p>All mankind clings to the hope that something escapes destruction
and rises unchangeable and eternal above the domain of nothingness. In
that hope we strive for better things and go forth to reform life, and
in the striving we find our spirit. We know we are shortsighted and
sometimes blind, and that the fight is often hopeless. But the joy,
the imperishable joy, lies in the struggle. Don Quixote is
inexpressibly dear to us because he personifies the ridiculous tasks
which we attempt, though we know them to be ridiculous.</p>

<p>There is a human need which is always paramount, yet surprisingly
little recognized. It is the need of an enemy. Life is a perpetual
<!-- Page 99 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
looking forward to a time when we shall have conquered. We are
happiest when we see the enemy in all his ugliness and wickedness, and
can draw our swords without any doubt as to his presence. We prefer
solid dragons of evil to flitting butterflies of sin. We are ever in
search of the enemy in our schemes of reform, our political wrangles,
our moral crusades.  The growth of individuality is indissolubly bound
up with cognizance of the enemy. He may be hiding in the bowels of the
earth, defying the attempt to tame the soil to our advantage; he may
be mocking our efforts to find scientific solutions to the riddles of
nature; he may be encamped in our own souls, confounding our goodness
and demolishing our moral defences. But he must be there. Without him
life would be stagnant, energy and virtue purposeless.</p>

<p>War satisfies the human hunger for a sight of the enemy. All the
vague sense of evil which in peace-time makes the morality of our
next-door neighbour a matter of anxious concern to us is now
solidified in hatred of the foe of the country. Smaller enmities are
patched, national brotherhood is recognized.
<!-- Page 100 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
The country at war with us becomes the target of all our moral
bullets. Tyranny, cruelty, lust, greed, and all manner of abomination
dwell there; its people are the servants of Antichrist.</p>

<p>The evil seen in the enemy stimulates unseen good in the masses, to
whom the sacrifices of war would be impossible but for the conviction
that the nations have been sharply divided into sheep and goats. The
abolition of war will come about when we have learnt to eliminate sham
enemies and to recognize the real one within our own hearts. In our
present stage of cosmic education, the idea of a negative peace is
entirely repellent. Now and then, after a bout of too much talking or
too much doing, we may dwell tenderly on the thought of complete
inaction and stillness. A nightmare is an excellent means of inducing
a desire for dreamless sleep. But normal, natural humanity shuns
complete rest. Hence the notorious failure&mdash;mental and
physical&mdash;of complete holidays. We must attack something, and if
there is no work to attack, we attack the inanimate stupidity of our
surroundings. It is strange that the laborious task once achieved
should so often become
<!-- Page 101 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
the thing abhorred. Scales fall from our eyes, perspective is
restored, and we see what a trumpery affair held us enthralled. I have
often thought with dismay of the effect on scores of reformers, whom I
know, if the reform to which they have sworn allegiance should be
accomplished. To many this would be a personal disaster of the gravest
kind. For years they have poured their mental energy and their
devotion into one channel. The enemy was always there, to be beaten at
sunrise and cursed at sunset.  The cause inspired high ideals and hard
work; self and selfish matters were neglected in the pursuit of
victory. Life eventually became identified with the cause and its
vicissitudes, and, like the picture in Olive Schreiner's story, the
work took on brighter and more wonderful colour, whilst the painter
became paler and paler. Narrowness of vision and purpose became
essential conditions of efficiency, and gradually human attributes
became sharpened into fanatical weapons of assault. Few reformers live
to see the triumph of their cause, and fewer still succeed in
preserving equilibrium of judgment.</p>

<p>There is, verily, every excuse for the pointed energy of
reformers. The world is full of
<!-- Page 102 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
horrors that cry aloud for extirpation; one head cannot easily harbour
knowledge of all the strongholds of wickedness.  True, those who are
called by the spirit to become missionaries of mercy can harbour a
greater measure of sympathy than the average man. The average man
suffers through incapacity to reach the fountain of spiritual
replenishment at which the saints refresh their parched throats. An
acute sensitiveness to the suffering of others, without a
corresponding power to reach the sources of comfort, leads to the
abyss of madness. Nature imposes limits to sympathy in most minds,
barriers of forgetfulness without which healthy thought is
impossible. The danger to the mind of indulging in unlimited sympathy
has been emphasized by the most divergent students of psychological
law. Herbert Spencer analysed it with characteristic
thoroughness. Nietzsche went farther. He reacted violently against the
onslaughts of pity in his own soul, and in philosophical self-defence
inverted the promptings of compassion. The war has shown the human
need of self-defence against excessive sympathy.  We are surfeited
with horrors on land and sea; the ghastly truth
<!-- Page 103 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
of a carnage which exceeds anything known in history, of maimed and
broken lives, of starving and homeless people, is shunned lest we lose
our reason in impotent and disruptive pity. The man of bayonet and
bomb, who a short time ago spent mildly exciting days over his desk in
the City, and who was anxiously concerned over the indisposition of
his neighbour's cat, has made himself a heart of steel for the
purposes of the war. If sympathy interfered with the issue of every
bullet and the thrust of every bayonet, there would be an end to
military efficiency.  The civilian has not seldom gone far beyond the
needs of emotional self-defence and equipped himself with a heart of
stone. The perfect Man of Sympathy&mdash;controlling His sympathy, yet
radiating it to all the world and its sins&mdash;was Jesus Christ. His
compassion had none of the corrosive qualities which drove Nietzsche
to distraction. He could retain the consciousness of all the suffering
which men inflict on fellow-creatures and yet keep ever abundant the
measure of His pity and the regenerating power of His love. He saw the
root of our evil, the one cause and the one remedy. He is the catholic
and consistent reformer, whilst
<!-- Page 104 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
we&mdash;we of the smaller measure&mdash;flounder in the web of a
hundred causes.</p>

<p>Each cause can be endowed with an importance which outdoes all the
others. Education&mdash;can any one deny the overwhelming need of
proper concentration on its possibilities? &ldquo;Here we have a
generation of ignorant, selfish, immoral creatures, devoid of a sense
of social responsibility,&rdquo; says our first reformer; &ldquo;why,
the remedy is obvious: let us begin with the children in the
schools. Is any one so dense as not to perceive the all-pervading
importance of the guidance we give to the young?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no use beginning with the children whilst those who
teach them are so hopelessly sunk in materialism and stupidity,&rdquo;
says our second reformer. &ldquo;Look at the education laws; they are
all ill-conceived and ill-administered. Education is not only a
failure; it is a dead-weight of falsehood and class tyranny which
hampers progress. Let us go straight for socialism and equal human
rights and opportunities. Your education is only used to perpetuate
industrial slavery and to keep the children of the working classes
ignorant of the blood-sucking system into whose meshes
<!-- Page 105 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
they will be thrown unless we combine and make our influence felt
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are neglecting the most obvious duties which should come
first,&rdquo; says the quiet and motherly voice of the third reformer;
&ldquo;infants die by the hundred thousand owing to neglect. There
will soon be no babies for you to instruct either in materialism or
socialism. The race will die out whilst you talk. Look at the slums
and the careless, ignorant mothers; we want infant-welfare work, we
want a new baby cult, we want to teach people parental
responsibility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; breaks in the virile voice of the fourth
reformer; &ldquo;what you want is to take people away from the slums,
to bring them back to the country. Land nationalization is what we
need&mdash;a free, healthy life, far removed from the factories that
kill soul and body by the grinding monotony of existence. Man was made
for life on the soil, for contact with sun and wind, flowers and
trees. They will give health and life to your babies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your schemes have only a secondary
importance&rdquo;&mdash;the voice of a prominent suffragist is now
heard. &ldquo;Give women the vote and
<!-- Page 106 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
these reforms will follow. Men have made all these abominable laws and
customs; women will bring in just and human laws and change all social
life. As for the suggestion that country life will improve the
standard of living, I can only say that it is made in ignorance of the
real conditions. Look at the farm labourer's wife and her
home-life. She is often the most miserable, worn-out creature, who
tries in vain to keep the children and herself properly fed and
clothed. Her life is a long travesty of the laws of health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; comments the temperance reformer,
&ldquo;whilst you allow the labourer to soak himself in drink and to
spend his money at the public-house. Drink is the root of all our
social troubles: it ruins the body and corrupts the mind, it poisons
the unborn children, fills our prisons and asylums. You may legislate
and equalize opportunities as much as you please; so long as you allow
the cursed liberty of drink there can be no health and no human
decency. Prohibition is the most urgent of all our needs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An athletic-looking young man, rosy-cheeked and clear-eyed, who had
been listening with a somewhat supercilious smile, now joins in
<!-- Page 107 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
the debate.  &ldquo;There would be no need for you to bother about
drink if you could persuade people to give up
flesh-eating. Vegetarianism is the cure of all ills. It drives away
disease and the craving for stimulants, it gives you pure blood and a
desire for the really simple life. I live in a tent on ninepence a day
and sleep in the open. I grow my own fruit and vegetables and do my
own cooking. Thoreau is my master and Carpenter my friend. I hate
smoky cities with their slums and their shambles and your whole sickly
civilization.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sickly!&rdquo; repeats a Christian Scientist, with
reproachful emphasis on the word. The speaker is a woman of sixty,
whose face bears the stamp of successful self-discipline and a sound
physique. &ldquo;I have seen vegetarians who looked extremely
sickly. Before I became a Christian Scientist I, too, sought health by
various systems of diet. Now I know that all disease is but an error
of mortal mind, and in <i>Science and Health</i>, by Mrs. Eddy, we are
told&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was not allowed to finish her sentence, for a Congregational
minister, famous for his pulpit denunciations of sin, has risen and
<!-- Page 108 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
gravely waves his hand to ensure a respectful hearing. &ldquo;All you
people,&rdquo; he says, in a voice vibrating with solemn indignation,
&ldquo;are pursuing fleeting shadows. The kingdom of God is
within. This false cult of health by self-hypnotism, or health by
living like the beasts in the field, gives undue weight to things
which, after all, relate to the body. It is the <i>soul</i> of man
that is important, not where he lives or what he eats. We need the
fear of God and the thirst for His mercy; we need the Divine guidance
which will transform and sanctify our social relations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And pray how has the Church dealt with the war?&rdquo; cries
the pacifist who has now risen, his eyes ablaze with denunciation of
the minister. &ldquo;The Christian Church&mdash;established or
unestablished&mdash;is nothing but the handmaid of the politician and
the State, the servile echo of capitalists and diplomatists. You talk
of Divine guidance and the sanctification of life. How do you respect
life and the teaching of Jesus Christ? Jesus said, 'Love your enemies,
bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, pray for
them that despitefully use you and persecute you.' You, His professed
followers, bless war and its
<!-- Page 109 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
orgies of hate. You stand by hypocritically thanking God for your own
sanctity, whilst Christians drench battlefields with the blood of
Christians. The abolition of war is the reform to which you should all
bend your lives and direct your prayers. Even now you have not learnt
your lesson. Your social order, your laws, your constitution, your
personal liberties, your lives and those of your children, are thrown
to the Juggernaut of war, and yet you continue your futile pursuit of
shadows. Without peace there can be no reform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have joined in the debate, I have heard all these voices. They
are familiar to me with the familiarity of the songs of our
childhood. Their sentiment is true, oh so true! yet so sadly
inadequate. The reformers are valiant and true, and every one has
hitched his waggon to his pet star. Happiest are those who do not
encounter the cross-influence of rival stars or see the irony of our
human limitation of sight and achievement. The blood-red cross of the
crusader will stand no admixture of colour. The soul dominated by one
idea gains ground. Henri Dunant, Florence Nightingale, Elizabeth Fry,
General Booth, Josephine Butler&mdash;these succeed by dint of their
singleness
<!-- Page 110 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
of purpose. The narrowness serves to concentrate the strength and
accelerate the work.</p>

<p>The reformer may be bigoted and unreasonable, but he must be an
optimist whilst pursuing his object. He must believe in life and in
the inherent goodness of the earth. He must be a stranger to the
dyspeptic melancholy through which Carlyle saw the world as a
&ldquo;noisy inanity&rdquo; and life as an incomprehensible
monstrosity. Macbeth is called to denounce life as &ldquo;a tale told
by an idiot, full of sound and fury,&rdquo; and &ldquo;signifying
nothing.&rdquo; Macbeth must be shunned by the reformer as the monk
repels the visits of Satan in the desert. He must share the
hopefulness of Sir Thomas More. Utopia is possible here, now, and
everywhere, though execution is likely to be the penalty of too close
application to principles.</p>

<p>He must not fear the companionship of the crank. He had better
recognize that he is one. What is a crank? The dictionary is somewhat
vague as to the meaning. I find that the verb is unravelled as
&ldquo;bend, wind, turn, twist, wind in and out, crankle,
crinkle.&rdquo; The last two appeal to me strongly. How I have
crankled and crinkled over wrongs and horrors
<!-- Page 111 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
which I have discovered on my little path! No crank can see his
crankiness at the time of crankling, though sometimes he sees it
afterwards. The crank is a person who holds views which to us seem
ridiculous. The man who first objected to cannibalism was a crank. The
man who first thought lunatics should not be chained to walls or left
naked on unsavoury beds of straw was a crank. Galileo was an
intellectual crank of the shameless type. Shelley is the beautiful
crank of all times, champion of forlorn causes, the inspired rebel of
the spirit.</p>

<p>There are small and noisy and irritating cranks. I have met scores
of them. They are intense, but shortsighted. Some are delightfully
ingenuous, with the lovable simplicity of the child. Others are of a
morbid and carping disposition, with an inordinate sense of their own
importance.</p>

<p>I have for many years been the privileged though unworthy recipient
of confidences and schemes for the elimination of all manner of
cruelty and wickedness from the world. My office in Piccadilly has
received within its sympathetic walls a procession of born cranks, of
souls charged with high missions for the
<!-- Page 112 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
betterment of the world. Faddists, eccentrics, dreamers, mystics,
workers chained to lifelong slavery by their dominant idea, have
poured out their plans to me. Sometimes visitors came who clearly had
crossed the unguarded frontier between sanity and insanity,
interesting and pathetic and clever, yet of the great order of God's
fools. They were not unhappy, for their path was brilliantly lit by an
idea, whilst the rest of the world was plunged in darkness. They would
scold me and pity me because I refused to follow their light, but they
were never unkind.</p>

<p>There is an old blue easy-chair in the office, dilapidated and
springless, in which I have deposited my cranks. I always choose a
hard, uncomfortable seat opposite, from which I conduct my defence
against the insidious appeal of the visitors. Their faces do not fade
from my memory. They haunt me with a gentle refrain of the
world-as-it-might-be.  The world as they would like it to be is
certainly not always habitable, but it is generally one of exuberant
imaginative verdure.</p>

<p>Here is the man who wants to abolish sex. He believes in spirit. He
is timid and womanly, his mind is pure and inexpressibly shocked at
<!-- Page 113 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
the carnal desires which disfigure the otherwise fair picture of
humanity.  Love, marriage, procreation, cannot these be purged from
the base and degrading obsessions of sex? By abstinence, by
concentration, we may eliminate them. Surely the story of the Fall
makes it quite clear that we were never meant to perpetuate such gross
mistakes.... Here is the woman who believes sex to be the source of
all good, all life, all joy.  She holds a medical degree and is
passionately opposed to the emancipation of womanhood. She is
unmarried, and dresses with old-fashioned emphasis of the eternal
feminine. With a soft and languid smile she deprecates the fate which
sent her to the medical school instead of the
nursery. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she tells me, with radiant eyes,
&ldquo;everything is sex; poetry, painting, sculpture, religion are
sex. Women who suppress their sexual nature by pursuing the chimerical
advantages of votes and professions are guilty of
race-suicide. Race-suicide must be stopped.&rdquo; There is the
believer in the immediate return of Jesus Christ and the approaching
end of the world. He comes as a convert with a message, and laden with
books of prophecy. A year ago he was still a successful man of
<!-- Page 114 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
business, and a gay soul with no inclination towards the holy
life. The merry twinkle in his eye has disappeared, and in its place I
see the dull glow of an obsessing idea. &ldquo;What is the good of all
your struggle and your agitation?&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;everything
will come right and the wicked will be punished. Join me in
proclaiming the coming of the Lord. Let people be warned and repent in
time.&rdquo; There is the lively, mercurial lady in green who deals in
statesmanship and high politics, who knows everybody of importance,
and who controls the fate of nations through her magic influence
behind the scenes. To-day she has been to the War Office, yesterday
the Home Office trembled at her approach, to-morrow certain officials
in high diplomatic circles will know to their cost what she thinks of
them. There is the pompous lady of a hundred committees. She has a
passion for committees, and no sooner has she formed one or sat on one
than she discovers the general unworthiness of the assembly. She comes
to expose people, to prove how utterly incapable they are of managing
affairs.</p>

<p>The priestess of some system of New Thought arrives. She is
pleasant and unruffled. &ldquo;Can you deny,&rdquo; she asks,
&ldquo;that nothing exists for
<!-- Page 115 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
you but that which you allow to enter your mind?&rdquo; No, I
cannot. &ldquo;Very well, then, you can control the universe by
thought. You can gain happiness, health, peace of mind, and long
life. By thought and meditation you can make for yourself a world of
harmony, a consciousness which excludes everything that is ugly and
painful and jarring.&rdquo; I murmur that this is no doubt possible,
but it seems a trifle selfish whilst so many human souls are
struggling in the sea of trouble. I am sharply pulled up. &ldquo;I
thought you would be too immersed in the wretched folly of agitation
to understand,&rdquo; she says; &ldquo;I came to show you the better
way.&rdquo; She is followed by the clothes enthusiast. He wears
sandals and has discarded the abomination of starched linen. &ldquo;We
are forming a Society for the Revival of Greek Clothing,&rdquo; he
announces. &ldquo;From the æsthetic and the hygienic points of view,
nothing is more important than the clothes we wear.&rdquo; I venture
on a feeble Teufelsdröckh joke. He does not condescend to
listen. &ldquo;We must get rid of hideous trousers and feet-strangling
skirts [I am lost in admiration over the indictment of the skirt, for
I remember a certain reception in Washington
<!-- Page 116 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
in the days of the snake-skirt when I stumbled and fell at a moment
when a little dignity would have been my most precious possession]; we
must wear loose white draperies amenable to the air and the
washtub.&rdquo; I quite agree, but raise some practical obstacles and
a few conventional pegs of delay. They prove intolerable, and my
visitor departs convinced that I am not one of the elect.</p>

<p>Missionaries of dietetics come in a motley procession. There is the
man who believes we can eat anything provided we masticate everything
with bovine thoroughness; there is the man who believes that we ought
to eat nothing during long bouts of purgative fasting, and who lives
cheerfully and inexpensively on hot water during two yearly periods of
twenty days.  There is the woman who has found the nearest approach to
nectar and ambrosia in the uncooked fruits and vegetables of the
earth, which, properly pounded, are digested, and make of our sluggish
bodies fit receptacles for Olympian wisdom. There are the people who
have discovered the one cause of all disease. It may be uric acid or
cell proliferation or hard water&mdash;there is always a complementary
cure. I listened one day with much interest
<!-- Page 117 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
to an exposition of the evils of salt. Salted food, I was told, is the
cause of our troubles. We are salted and dried until all power of
recuperation is driven out of our nerves and muscles. I was asked to
study the subject. The theory was well supported by scientific
reasoning and evidence, and on the following evening I had thoroughly
entered into the saltless ideal. A vision of the dispirited haddock
had materially assisted my conclusion when a visitor was announced. He
was preceded by a card showing impressively that he was a man of
learning in theories of disease. &ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;in the hope that you will take an interest in my experiments
and conclusions with regard to disease in general. I have discovered
that the one cure for rheumatism, consumption, and cancer is salt,
plenty of common salt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The trouble with all these people is not that they are all
wrong. They are probably all right. It is a question of angles and
quality of the grey matter of the brain. The trouble is the limitation
of experience and outlook imposed by fate upon each individual.</p>

<p>A league or society is theoretically the one human institution
which is akin to heaven.
<!-- Page 118 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
You have an object and a programme. You know you are occupied with the
most important task in the world. But you feel powerless alone. You
send out your appeal for support and kindred souls flock to your
banner. Can anything be more soul-satisfying than a community of those
who think alike, who feel alike, and who work for the same end?
Anarchy is impossible, and you decide on a constitution and rules for
the management of your spiritual brotherhood. A committee is appointed
to control the affairs of the union, and officials to carry out its
wishes. Now you have the ideal of which you dreamt, the pure
collective force which should prove irresistible. Friends within and
enemies without.</p>

<p>But you have not excluded the canker of human differences. Your
kindred souls discover that, though they think alike on the one point
which drew you together, they differ strongly on others. There are
other opinions, religious and political, than those which come within
the purview of your little organization. You surprise some of your
friends in the act of discussing your denseness in matters of which
they have a firm and clear grasp. You begin to wonder how it is
possible for
<!-- Page 119 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
people who have such a perfect vision of certain necessary lines of
reform to manifest such unmitigated stupidity in regard to others. If
you are wise, you resign yourself to the inevitable divergence of
mind; if they are wise, they agree to pardon your shortcomings.</p>

<p>Fanatics flower in a society like poppies in a wheat-field. They
have lost sight of everything but the urgency of the cause. They are
intolerant because they have no knowledge of human nature and no
self-criticism wherewith to check the wild ideas that sprout beneath
their immense self-confidence. They turn withering scorn on committees
and officials who refuse to give effect to their suggestions to burn
the House of Commons, or stop the traffic of London, or commit
combined suicide in Hyde Park as a protest against the continuance of
the iniquity which they denounce. They would do things in a different
manner. They intend to show the world and politicians that their views
cannot be ignored with impunity. For you and your lukewarm followers
they have nothing but contempt&mdash;the contempt which is earned by
the coward. The fanatic is troublesome, but comparatively easy to deal
with.  There is another product of
<!-- Page 120 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
organized reform on which you cannot so easily shut the door. It is
the ideologue who rides the scheme to death.  It is the doctrinaire
who must form systems within systems and policies within policies. It
is not enough that you have set out to suppress something or to
encourage something. You must follow his particular way.  He is in
terror of compromise and sees profligacy in sweet reasonableness. He
knows the tragic failure of other movements with vacillating
policies. This one must be saved at all costs. 'Twere better to smash
the whole movement than proceed along undesirable lines. He would
scorn victory that came through avenues not recognized by him.
Certain words and phrases have completely captivated his imagination.
With them he fences heroically and causes a sufficiency of clatter and
noise. He is in deadly earnest and will brook no rivals. Parties
within parties are formed, and the energies which should be directed
towards fighting opponents are absorbed in combat within the
society.</p>

<p>There is another element of disaster which now and then gains
ascendancy in the community of reformers. It is the professional
agitator, the parasite who will speak for or
<!-- Page 121 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
against a principle according to the economic advantage which one side
or the other may offer. You may hold that such a man is not altogether
undesirable, provided he can &ldquo;organize&rdquo; and persuade
people that the society is worthy of support.  You may think that he
is no more blameworthy than the lawyer who pleads your views so
eloquently and who handles the jury with such consummate skill, though
his sole incentive is your fee and not your case. If you act on such a
belief and allow your professional agitator to manage your society,
you will certainly one day find your ideals turned to ashes and your
organization for moral action turned into money-making machinery.</p>

<p>Whilst life teaches you that societies are frail human institutions
and that conferences and congresses do not bring about the millennium,
you are saved from despair if you keep ever fresh your sense of
humour.</p>

<p>There are problems in the life of the reformer which the mountains
never fail to put before me. I have so often come to them from the
heat and turmoil of controversy. I have come like a soldier from
battle, covered with mud and slightly wounded, yet exultant in the
<!-- Page 122 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
spirit of the fray.  The mountains speak to me, and lo! another self
appears. They speak to me of beauty, of peace, of the infinite mystery
of life; they give me broad effects of light and shade, and obliterate
the small pictures which pursue me on the plains. Yesterday, in the
stillness of Alpine midwinter, the moon shone clear and full on the
glacier. I sat gazing at the outlines of the peaks trembling in the
pale light of a perfect evening. The noisy mountain torrents were held
captive in prisons of ice, but here and there the sound of an
irrepressible rivulet threading its underground way through stones and
earth brought to my ears a song of spring. I love the trees, the sky,
the snow&mdash;all my senses respond to the call of the solitude of
Nature. I felt free and happy; I sank into the state of bliss in which
the soul is conscious of no desire. Surely this is better than the
strife and the sordid cares of the camp; surely one may walk apart and
enjoy the fruits of tranquillity? Our consciousness can admit but an
infinitesimal part of that which is: let us then fill it to the brim
with the joy of beauty, with the harmony of being at rest. Then I
remembered the things which lay beyond my peaks and my
<!-- Page 123 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
moonlight: a vision of prisons and shambles, of battlefields and
slums, passed before my eyes. How can one forget! How can one enjoy
peace and beauty! Duty bids us to descend, love bids us to share the
suffering.</p>

<p>And yet are there not two ways of seeking perfection, two paths
clearly defined and well trodden throughout the ages&mdash;reform of
self and reform of others? What may at first sight appear as æsthetic
or mystic egoism is perhaps the better way. The hermit who forsakes
the world and renounces the social ties and burdens which most men
count of value is bent on the purification of his own
soul. Monasticism&mdash;with all its faults&mdash;recognized the
essential need of self-examination and self-discipline. It bade us
cleanse our souls, conquer our own temptations, by a rigid system of
religious exercise. Our modern reformer is not always conscious of any
need for self-reform. He lustily attacks the misdoings of others and
remains happily ignorant of the Socratic rule, <i>Know
thyself</i>. &ldquo;Every unordered spirit is its own
punishment,&rdquo; says St. Augustine, and the disorder is not removed
by assaulting the faults of others. We have, first and last, to be
captains
<!-- Page 124 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
of our own souls. There is an element of absurdity in the thought that
the aim and purpose of human life is for each soul to hunt for the
sins and imperfections in others. The enjoinment of self-criticism and
self-culture seems a simpler and less circumstantial rule of
life. Asceticism, abnegation, prayer, remoteness from the passions
that rend the worldly, bring peace and content. But they limit
experience and give a false simplicity to the problems of life. Early
Christian monasticism held that as this world is the domain of the
devil, the only safety lies in flight from it. Such a view precludes
the possibility of social reform on a general and lasting basis. It
has a radical consistency and a scientific precision which are only
disturbed by the course of actual events. Supposing all humanity could
be withdrawn, every precious brand snatched from the burning and the
whole made into a vast monastery? The devil would be sure to slip in
and cause a disturbance.</p>

<p>The social reformer assumes that the world is worthy of his care,
and that we are here to make it as habitable as we can. He lives in
the midst of sinful humanity and accepts the inheritance of earthly
conventions. He
<!-- Page 125 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
may choose to live in the slums whilst his spirit clamours for a
hermitage amongst the blue hills. His ways may be crotchety and his
temper irritable&mdash;what does it matter so long as he is carrying
out his appointed task in the cosmic order?</p>

<p>To the true nature-lover there is no renunciation in forsaking the
things prized by most men. His virtue may be vice concealed; he
gathers bliss where others find boredom. Give me a tree, a perfect
tree, and you may keep your palaces. Give me the green fields with a
hundred thousand flowers, and you may keep your streets and your piles
of gold. Give me the wild wind and the breath of the torrent, and I
have no wish to hear your hymns. There is a brazen self-sufficiency
about the nature-lover which baffles and offends the mind of the
crowd. The most amazing thing about him is that he turns hardship and
deprivation into pleasure. Take away his house and he shelters in a
cave. Deprive him of your company and he laughs to himself. Take away
his possessions and he tells you he is rich because he wants so
little, whilst you are poor, for you have surrounded yourself with a
hundred unnecessary wants. Like Antæus, the
<!-- Page 126 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
mythical giant, he derives his strength and his power to overcome
enemies from contact with the earth. He discovers a mode of being,
behind and beyond ordinary existence. He says to the busy crowds of
industry and commerce, to the men and women who wear out their lives
in the joyless chase of success: &ldquo;You will die before you know
satisfaction and rest. Come and be human, come and grow in the
sunshine and the rain.&rdquo; He finds that two-thirds of the reforms
for which men labour would not be needed if the artificialities of
society were abandoned. He is, of course, unpractical and
self-centred. Listen to Thoreau, the arch-enemy of the social
treadmill, and to his scorn of reformers:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Who is that intemperate and brutal man whom
we would redeem? If anything ail a man so that he does not perform his
functions, if he have a pain in his bowels even&mdash;for that is the
seat of sympathy&mdash;he forthwith sets about reforming&mdash;the
world. Being a microcosm himself, he discovers&mdash;and it is a true
discovery, and he is the man to make it&mdash;that the world has been
eating green apples; to his eyes, in fact, the globe itself is a great
green apple, which there is danger awful to think of that the children
of men will nibble before it is ripe; and straightway his drastic
philanthropy seeks out the Esquimaux and the Patagonian, and embraces
the populous
<!-- Page 127 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Indian and Chinese villages; and thus by a few years of philanthropic
activity, the powers in the meanwhile using him for their own ends, no
doubt, he cures himself of his dyspepsia, the globe acquires a faint
blush on one or both of its cheeks, as if it were beginning to be
ripe, and life loses its crudity and is once more sweet and wholesome
to live.</p></div>

<p>And whilst thus branding those who set out to reform others, he
shows his adherence to the great order of self-reformers by the
following conclusion:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>I never dreamed of any enormity greater than
I have committed. I never knew, and never shall know, a worse man than
myself.</p></div>

<p>Thoreau cultivates simplicity with an intense regard for the effect
on himself. He is&mdash;in spite of his seclusion&mdash;above all a
prophet amongst men. He made great discoveries in the realm of the
mind&mdash;the mind attending closely to Nature, but he is too much
the naturalist and the land-surveyor to lose himself in the raptures
of nature love. He is a stranger to the ethereal touch with which
Fiona Macleod opens the magic door of that which is felt but not seen
in earth and sky. He misses the mystic hour when ghosts of the green
<!-- Page 128 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
life are about. That hour has been seized by Algernon Blackwood, who
makes us feel the fascination, the vague dread of the elemental
powers. There is a dream-wood in which the souls of all things
intermingle, and once imprisoned there, the nature-lover may not
escape until he has paid toll to the pixies.</p>

<p>There is, after all, nothing incompatible in the life of
self-enrichment and the life of self-expenditure. They are
interdependent, and rule the ancient order of gnosis and
praxis. Whether we go to nature or religion or science for
replenishment, we must be filled. And the ironic power which presides
over our feasts compels the most inveterate egoist amongst us to share
his treasures. Mind is for ever craving to give to mind. If we want
nothing better than to boast of our superiority, the boasting imparts
a lesson to others and is therefore a gift. But the reforming spirit
spares few who think. It is generally believed that the purely
literary mind scorns the idea of reforming: that art is above moral
purpose. I have yet to discover the purely literary mind. Homer and
Shakespeare, Goethe and Dante are clearly not of it. Shakespeare, so
say the wiseacres, is the strictly impartial dramatist.
<!-- Page 129 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
He depicts the good and the bad, the great and the small, with
complete detachment.  Naturally, the art is the detachment and the
lesson is in the perfect representation. The literary man may
indignantly repudiate the idea of &ldquo;preaching.&rdquo; &ldquo;To
go preach to the first passer by,&rdquo; wrote Montaigne, &ldquo;to
become tutor to the ignorance of the first I meet, is a thing I
abhor.&rdquo; He may have abhorred the idea, but through his essays he
made himself tutor to innocence and the model of subjective
moralizing.</p>

<p>However widely we roam the Republic of Letters, we meet no citizen
without a badge of consecrated service. Pretenders, perhaps, usurpers
of the titles of others, men to whom literature is nothing but
merchandise.  These may be totally free from the impulse. Tolstoy,
Ibsen, Hauptmann, Hugo are reformers of the first order, whose words
are charged with revolt. The transcendentalism of Emerson, the
naturalism of Zola, the cynicism of La Rochefoucauld are all
convergent streams in the torrent of reforming words which make the
soul fertile.</p>

<p>No; the tame and vapid acquiescents are not to be found in
literature. Sometimes
<!-- Page 130 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
they furnish material for literature. Their principal use in life is
to kindle the souls of reformers with the resentment of which great
deeds are born.</p>

<h2>NATIONALITY</h2>

<p>I can remember no time in my life when I was not addicted to the
study of humanity. The marvels of faces, types, and characteristics
were, I feel sure, with me in my cradle. At the age of ten I had
evolved a kind of astrological chart of my own, according to which all
human beings, including uncles and aunts, grandmothers and children,
could be placed in twelve categories. There were the long-nosed,
thin-lipped, sandy-haired, over-principled people, who always knew
right from wrong and who grudged me an extra chocolate because it was
not the hour to have one. There were the snub-nosed, full-lipped,
dark-eyed people, whose manners were jolly and who positively
encouraged illicit consumption of fruit in the thin-lipped aunt's
garden. There were the shortsighted, solemn people with bulging
foreheads and studious habits who saw print and nothing else. They
bored me and belonged to my eleventh category. As far as I can see
now, my categories were a
<!-- Page 132 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
florid elaboration of the four temperaments of Hippocrates, though I
have no idea of the cause of my childish absorption in the subject. It
was certainly altogether spontaneous and not encouraged, for I have a
vivid recollection of how an eager and eloquent description of my
categories (profusely illustrated by mimicry) brought me a sharp
reprimand and a very nasty tonic. The tonic was taken under
compulsion, but the cure is still unaccomplished.</p>

<p>And now for many years I have sat at my chalet window and seen the
world go by. The path from the village below to the peaks and pastures
above runs past my nest. On it, in the summer months, there was a
straggling procession of tourists and climbers, peasants and
townsfolk. They were of all nationalities, and their loud voices
proclaimed the immutability of the curse of Babel. I used to be
annoyed at the close proximity of the path, until, one day, I
discovered its marvellous opportunities for anthropological
research. Then I settled down, content to limit my wooing of the
solitude to the early morning and the late evening, or the time when
the wild autumnal gales brush the mountains clear of trippers and
paint the surrounding foliage

in glorious tints of red and gold.  For I assure you the proper study
of man is man, and the proper study of woman is both man and
woman.</p>

<p>Here comes the Parisian youth with his charming young mamma of
forty.  His face is pale and <i>distingué</i>, and the black down on
his upper lip has been trained with infinite care. Though his grey
mountain suit is fashioned for great feats of daring, it has the
rounded waist and martial shoulder-lines with which the Parisian
tailor pacifies his conscience when he supplies English fashions. His
stockings look ferocious. His dark eyes sparkle with inquisitiveness
behind the pince-nez. He is vivacity incarnate, he is urbanity on a
holiday. Mamma takes his arm and they trip past me. She is pretty, and
would be plump if the art of the <i>corsetière</i> had not abolished
plumpness. Her hat conveys a greeting from the Rue Lafayette, her
little high-heeled boots show faultless ankles and the latest way of
lacing up superfluous fat above them. A hole and two uneven stones
maliciously intercept the progress of that little foot. Mamma
stumbles, and is promptly and chivalrously replaced in an upright
position by the son. &ldquo;Mon Dieu!&rdquo; she cries; &ldquo;what a
path!&rdquo; and through my open window
<!-- Page 134 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
there floats the odour of <i>poudre-de-riz</i> disturbed by nervous
excitement. Papa follows. He is fat. No one can deny it, and I do not
think he would like any one to try. Honesty is writ large on his
rotund countenance. Now he is hot and somewhat weary with the
climb. He carries his hat under his arm and large pearls of moisture
shine on the puckered forehead. His hair is thick and closely cropped,
and strives upward with the even aspiration of a doormat. His cheeks
are a little sallow and pendulous. He smiles under his thin moustache,
the contented smile of an honest, hardworking, successful man. I know
him well; I seem to have met him in a hundred editions in the offices
of municipalities and prefectures, behind the counters of banks and
shops. He is generally amiable, but he can lose his temper, and when
he loses it, it is worth your while to help him to find it.</p>

<p>Here comes the Heidelberg professor, accompanied by two fair
daughters.  He is tall, of commanding presence, and walks with
patriarchal gravity under a green umbrella. A large pocket,
embroidered and ingeniously designed with numerous compartments, is
strapped to his waist. He strokes his long,
<!-- Page 135 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
well-trimmed beard as he admonishes the girls to pay serious attention
to the natural beauty of the scenery. He rummages the pocket for his
field-glasses. &ldquo;This, dear children, is Mont Blanc. I do not say
that our Schwarzwald is not just as lovely in its way. This mountain
was first climbed by Paccard and Balmat. It stretches from the Col de
Balme to the Col du Bonhomme and the Col de la Seigne. [A book is now
extracted from the fourth division of the pocket.] There are the
following passes: the Col d'Argentière, the Col....&rdquo; His
eye-glasses slip downwards on his nose. The girls are not
listening. Gretchen is entirely absorbed in the fascinating appearance
of an Italian who has just passed, and who by unmistakable signs
conveyed to her that she is adorable. His flashing eyes, his jet-black
hair, his lithe figure, his pointed toes, the nimble way in which he
managed to press her hand behind the very back of her father, have
stirred her imagination. Hedvig is shocked. The elder daughter is
permeated with respect for her father's professorial dignity. Every
gesture betrays the capable housekeeper. She seems to be made of
squares&mdash;good, proper, solid squares. She
<!-- Page 136 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
tells the smiling Gretchen, whose cheeks suggest strawberries and
cream, that she must never encourage dark Italians by looking at
them. She should look at the ground when such men pass. She should be
more attentive to father. The sound of their footsteps dies, and the
green umbrella is but a dream. Hedvig has filled my window with
visions of a well-ordered German home, of sausages and
<i>Sauerkraut</i>, of beer and pickled fruit, of embroideries and
coffee-parties.</p>

<p>Here comes a hatless representative of young Russia. His clothes
are shabby and neglected; he walks with a shuffling, tired
movement. But his face is startling. It seems to light up the path
with some kind of spiritual fervour. His hair is long and golden, his
beard suggests an aureole of virtue, his large blue eyes are
penetrating but mild. A confused series of faces flash through my
mind&mdash;Abraham, Tolstoy, Jesus Christ? Yes, it may seem
sacrilegious, but the man is like Jesus Christ.  I see now that the
likeness is studied, cultivated, impressive. This is one of the
<i>intelligentsia</i> who has lingered for a while in Geneva or
Lausanne <i>en route</i> for the haunts of spiritual revolution. A din
of dear familiar voices now fills the path and
<!-- Page 137 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
seems to shake the tops of the pines. &ldquo;I guess you won't try
that again. I did Munich in one day, Dresden in one and a half, Berlin
in two, and Europe in twenty.&rdquo; Three women and a man stop
opposite the chalet. The ladies are charmingly dressed in summer
frocks of white and pink and blue, and carry nothing heavier than a
parasol. The man is laden with cloaks, rugs, and bags.  They peer into
my window and try to catch a glimpse of the interior. I hastily draw
the curtains and leave one peep-hole for myself. &ldquo;Quaint houses
these Swiss live in,&rdquo; says one. &ldquo;It isn't a bad
shanty,&rdquo; says the man. &ldquo;Let's have a glass of milk,&rdquo;
says another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dew lait,&rdquo; they shout through the window. I callously
observe them through my peep-hole. The man is of a fine American type,
sinewy, resolute, hawk-eyed. The mountain sunshine provides me with
Röntgen rays, and I see Wall Street inside his brow. &ldquo;Dew
lait,&rdquo; they yell. As there is no answer, they hammer at the
door. The door is adamant. They leave reluctantly. &ldquo;I think I
saw the face of one of those Swiss idiots through the curtains,&rdquo;
says the lady in pink; &ldquo;of course he would not understand what
we said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a delightful readiness to jump to conclusions on the part
of visitors. Sometimes they are the reverse of flattering, but they
are always a source of delighted interest to me. I remember one day,
years ago, when I had gone to draw water at the source, which emerges
as a thousand diamonds from the rock and then descends into the hollow
trunk of a tree and becomes tame and inclined to domesticity. The cows
had come for a drink at the same hour, and we had just exchanged a few
polite remarks when I found myself observed by an English clergyman.
Yes, unmistakably English. His face was prim and clean-shaven, his
collar straight and stiff, upon his lips there played a sweet and
devout smile. He lifted up the tail of his coat ceremoniously and,
selecting a clean stone, seated himself upon it. He radiated
condescending kindness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lor a bun,&rdquo; said he. I asked the cows to excuse me for
a moment and turned to him. &ldquo;Lor a bun,&rdquo; he repeated, this
time with a query. I stared uncomprehendingly. The sweet smile became
sweeter. &ldquo;Lor a bun, ma pettit fille, eh?&rdquo; At last I
understood. &ldquo;Oh, yes, the water is excellent here,&rdquo;
<!-- Page 139 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
I replied, &ldquo;and freezingly cold if you put your fingers in
it.&rdquo; He departed in unceremonious haste.</p>

<p>For some years I have watched the procession of nations on my path.
French, German, English, Russian, Austrian, American,
Italian&mdash;they all brought me a picture of their tribal
characteristics, trivial, thumbnail sketches, but nevertheless true to
life. It may be urged that holiday-makers do not constitute reliable
material for the observation of national peculiarities. I am not so
sure. A man on a holiday generally takes his goodwill with him, and
endeavours, at least, to restrain his temper and his prejudices. He
may fail in the attempt, and be a peevish thing at play, but the
attempt will show him at his best.  From the hotels below, where the
crowds of cosmopolis stayed <i>en pension</i> at reasonable and
unreasonable terms, the sound of music and songs visited me in the
evening. The nations were waltzing.  International peace reigned under
the auspices of the Swiss hotel keeper. Forgotten were the ancient
feuds of dynasty and religion. Common humanity was uppermost.</p>

<p>And now the nations are at war. The concourse
<!-- Page 140 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
of friendly strangers who used to meet in the hotels is sharply
divided into hostile groups.  Travel is suspended or severely
restricted. The Frenchman who a short time ago raised his glass in
friendly salute to the German at the opposite table, who had guided
him across the moraine, is now convulsed at the thought that he could
ever forget the essentially brutal and inhuman character of all
Germans. The German wishes he had dropped the Frenchman into the
crevasse. There would then, he argues, have been one less of these
treacherous, mean people, whose love of military conquest is only
checked by impotence. He remembers Napoleon and the fact that any
insignificant-looking chip of the Latin block may one day threaten the
heart of Germany. The easy and good-humoured internationalism of
tourist-life is at an end.</p>

<p>I do not know to what extent modern facilities for inexpensive
travel have helped to establish friendship and understanding between
the nations. But I do know that a person who claims to be educated,
and who has never travelled abroad, is insufferably boresome. I prefer
the society of a mole. The mole does not lecture me on the
incalculable advantages
<!-- Page 141 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
of remaining in one's dark passages. I do not shut my eyes to the fact
that some people go abroad and come home with their stupidity
unmodified by experience. But they have been made uncomfortable, and
that is something. A series of pricks of discomfort might dislodge the
obstacles to mental circulation. A Swiss hotel may serve to check the
contempt which the Philistines of all nations (there is a truly
international bond between them) feel at the thought of a foreigner,
though the shock of finding oneself amongst such peculiarities of
clothes, or frisure, or table-manners may be almost
unbearable. &ldquo;Can you tell me,&rdquo; said a charming but
agitated old lady from Bath one day, &ldquo;of a hotel where there are
no foreigners?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am afraid I cannot,&rdquo; I
answered. &ldquo;The hotel you have in mind would be full of
foreigners in Switzerland, and you would but add to their
number.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even the most cosmopolitan habitués of Nice, or Monte Carlo, or
Homburg feel the mildly stimulating effect of being in the presence of
foreigners. You are interested or disgusted, you are attracted or
repelled; your curiosity is aroused; you guess, you weave romances,
you make conscious use of the rich material
<!-- Page 142 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
for comparison which lies before you. In Europe, apparently, the
nations meet but do not merge.  America achieves the miracle. I
remember one evening in New York. I had addressed a meeting of good
Americans and was coming home in the train.  I was tired and
unobservant and kept my eyes closed. Suddenly a loud remark in Danish
attracted my attention. I looked up at the row of humanity in the long
carriage. Sitting opposite me, standing at my side, hanging by the
straps, were the nations of the world. The racial types were there:
Slavonic, Latin, Teutonic; the skull dolichocephalic and the skull
brachycephalic rested side by side without any attempt at mutual
evacuation. I could distinguish the faces of Frenchmen, Jews,
Englishmen, Japanese, Germans, Poles, negroes, Italians. They did not
study one another. They were journeying home from the day's work. A
strange homogeneity brooded over the company. America had put her
super-stamp on their brows. They were citizens of an all-human
country.</p>

<p>What, then, is this mysterious power which seems to master the Old
World, whilst it is mastered by the New World? Nationality is
<!-- Page 143 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
clearly a mundane thing. It is not generally suggested that heaven is
mapped out into national frontiers; the Christian religion and other
faiths are bent on roping in all the nations. The missionaries who are
sent out to Africa and China go with the conviction that there is room
in heaven for the black and the yellow sinner. True, the black and the
yellow man will first have to shed their somewhat irregular appearance
and come forth white and radiant, but the belief in the possibility of
such a feat is proof positive that we regard the nationality of a man
as a transient business. Nationality is local, spirituality
universal. Nationality is a form, a mould, a means; spirituality is
the essence, the force, the object. The problems of nationality are
wrapped up in the problems of personality. A personality is an amalgam
of likes and dislikes, of habit and prejudice, the product of
circumstances and a will. There is such a thing as multiple
personality, and there is also multiple nationality.  But the simple
measure of nationality is severely natural and elemental.  It is
rooted in the need of understanding and being understood. It begins
with love of self (we do love ourselves, in spite of all assurances to
the contrary),
<!-- Page 144 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
family, and tribe. In a world of diversity and uncertainty it envelops
us with a comforting assurance that there are creatures who feel and
think as we do. It endows us with a group-soul, without which we, like
ants and bees, cannot face life. The sense of nationality is but an
enlarged sense of personality.</p>

<p>It is a realization of unity which comprises many lesser units. Our
household, our village, our country, our constituency, are all
independent unities which we deliberately (though not always
successfully) press into the service of the greater unity. The lesser
unities always run the danger of being superseded by the greater
unities. The conditions of soil and climate in a hamlet produce a crop
of personalities similar in content and range, a type which we may
distinguish by the shape of the nose or the trend of the remarks. Ten
neighbouring little hamlets may have their little ways of distinction
which separate one from the other, and yet one day&mdash;to their
dismay&mdash;discover that they have greater generalities in
common. Once the discovery is made, prudence and common sense demand
co-operation. The great nations are built up on the discovery. Italy,
Germany, and Great Britain
<!-- Page 145 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
have taken it to heart after endless trials of the smaller
unities. America had one severe trial, and then settled down to
circumvent and undo the curse of Babel. The sense of separateness,
once so precious to Florence, Genoa, and Pisa, could not resist the
larger conception of Italy.</p>

<p>There is no reason, historical or logical, why this expansion of
the consciousness of unity should not proceed until there is nothing
further to include. The recognition of an all-human brotherhood is
followed by the realization of an all-animal brotherhood in which the
essential likeness of all that breathes and feels is
paramount. Personally, I have never found the slightest difficulty in
accepting our near relationship to the apes. On the contrary, every
monkey I meet&mdash;and I have specially cultivated their
acquaintance&mdash;reminds me sharply of the simian origin of our
dearest traditions.</p>

<p>The consciousness of unity and the consequent sense of separateness
from some other body or bodies are subject to constant change and
surprisingly erratic in their application. A bare hint to the
Welshman, the Scotsman, the Breton, the Provençal, or the Bavarian
<!-- Page 146 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
that his national idiosyncrasies do not exist, and you will speedily
see a demonstration of them. And yet, a moment ago, they felt entirely
British or French or German. Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians have each a
keen sense of national separateness (and superiority), but let the
tongue of slander touch their common nature, and Scandinavia rises in
indignant unity. I have attended many International Congresses, and
have observed how easily the party is on the verge of grave national
crises. Each alliance musters a good-humoured tolerance of the
deficiencies of others. But let an opponent of the whole scheme, for
which they have assembled, attack the principle which is sacred to
all, and there is an immediate truce and concerted action against the
intruder. Russian and German troops have found it necessary to suspend
their fighting in order to defend themselves against the attacks of
wolves. The hungry pack of wolves, waiting by the trenches at night,
presented a force which called for united opposition, and the European
war had to wait whilst the men of the opposite armies joined in
killing them. When the slaughter of wolves was happily over, the human
battle was resumed.
<!-- Page 147 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Supposing, instead of wolves, an airship of super-terrestrial
proportions had brought an army of ten-armed, four-headed, and
six-legged creatures, bent on dealing out death to the occupants of
the trenches, what would have happened? Supposing the inhabitants of a
more cruel and vicious planet than ours (cosmological specialists
assure us such exist) developed powers of warfare before which the
exploits of Hannibal or Attila paled into insignificance, and learnt
the art of destroying life not only in their own world but in others
as well? They might come armed with new atmospheric weapons, trailing
clouds of suffocating fumes to which resistance with guns and bombs
would be utterly ineffectual. The horror of the unknown danger would
paralyse the war, batteries would be deserted and the trenches would
quickly be internationalized. The sense of our common humanity,
outraged at the sight and the smell of the monsters, would assert
itself. Generals and statesmen of the belligerent peoples&mdash;if any
were left to direct the defensive&mdash;would hold subterranean
meetings, and, forgetting the cause for which they sent men to die
nobly but a few days ago, would discuss how they could
<!-- Page 148 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
save the united remnants of humanity by strategy and simulation.</p>

<p>The sense of unity is, after all, dependent on innumerable
conditions and circumstances over which we have little control. There
is the unity of tradition and education, of Eton and Harrow, of Oxford
and Cambridge.  It moulds opinion and imposes certain restrictions of
conduct and prejudices in outlook. Rivalry is an indispensable and
normal adjunct of such unity. Races and the honour and glory of one's
school and team can stir the group-soul to incredible heights of
enthusiasm and effort.  There is the instinctive unity of
seafarers. Who has not, when crossing the ocean, felt that he was part
of a small world independent and isolated from others, but bound
together by special ties of adventure?  An encounter with an iceberg
will bring the common responsibilities and dangers to the notice of
the most inveterate individualist, but even while the ship moves
uneventfully forward, he, perforce, shares the feeling of
oneness. There is the humorous unity which will seize the opposing
parties in a court of law and make them join in laughter at some
feeble judicial joke just to experience the relief
<!-- Page 149 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
of forgetting that they are there to be contentious.</p>

<p>The advocates of the theory that nations and nationalities are
eternally distinct and separate can see no analogy of unity in the
simple examples of everyday life. They tell us conclusively that
England is England and France is France, and our humble retort that we
know as much and something besides is silenced by the further
information that each nation has a soul that will tolerate no
interference from other souls.  They forget, our apostles of the creed
of separateness, that the States of to-day are built up on a vast
mixture of races and nationalities.  They forget, also, that
nationality is not a fixed and immovable quantity. Like personality,
it is alive and changing, susceptible to influence and experience,
liable to psychic contagion from the thoughts and emotions of
others. There is no pure nationality. Hybrids are regarded as inferior
creatures, as biological outlaws. The truth is, we are all
hybrids. Our bluest blood has all the shades of common colour in it
when examined ethnically. Great Britain&mdash;and
Ireland&mdash;contains a mixture of Romans, Angles, Jutes, Saxons,
Danes, Normans, and
<!-- Page 150 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Celts.  To-day, Scotch, Welsh, and Irish are mixtures within
mixtures. And what is the British Empire? A conglomeration of races
and languages, a pan-national product of conquest and colonization, in
which the forces of racial modification are always at work
obliterating old divisions and creating new claims to national
recognition.</p>

<p>The Russian Empire, sown by Vikings, Slavs, and Mongols, has a rich
racial flora, including Germans, Poles, Jews, Lithuanians, Letts,
Roumanians, Afghans, Tartars, Finns, and scores of others. The Great
Russians, the White Russians, and the Little Russians may each claim
to have sprung from the purest Russian stock, but no one has as yet
been able to settle satisfactorily the meaning of that claim. The
Russians have successively been proved to be of Mongol, Slav,
Teutonic, Aryan, Tartar, Celto-Slav, and Slav-Norman origin. Italy,
believed to be the home of pure Latin blood, has sheltered and mingled
a great number of races, such as Egyptians, Greeks, Spaniards, Slavs,
Germans, Jews, and Normans. The Republics of Central and South America
are to a large extent peopled by half-breeds. Here the commingling is
flagrant and offensive
<!-- Page 151 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
to the partisan of the superiority of the white race. Spain in Mexico
and Portugal in Brazil have produced a wild-garden crop which is the
despair of the custodian of racial law and order. The search for
national purity brings many unexpected discoveries and destroys
various theories. It reveals the fact that America has no monopoly of
racial amalgamation.</p>

<p>France and Germany appear to us as opposites and
irreconcilables. Yet, if you pursue Germany to the hour of her birth
you will find that her mother was France. Examine France
physiologically and you will find that her muscles and arteries have a
German consistency. A thorough investigation of the origins of Germany
may prove that she is more Gaulish than Gaul. The Germanic invasions
of France are matters of elementary history. Originally a mixture of
Ligurians, Celts, Ph&oelig;nicians, Greeks, and Romans, she is only
Latin in part. Cæsar conquered Gaul, but the Roman mixture has not
obliterated previous or subsequent additions. The Latin blood of
France was thoroughly diluted by Visigoths, Burgundians, Franks,
Vandals, Normans, and other peoples of Germanic stamp. When Gaul was
<!-- Page 152 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
partitioned into the Burgundian kingdom, Austrasia, and Neustria,
there were already present the selective processes which, centuries
later, shaped the French and the German souls. Neustria clung to Roman
culture, whilst Austrasia nurtured the seeds of the specific
<i>Kultur</i> which attained its full bloom in the twentieth
century. Through rivalry and war the two types persisted.  Charlemagne
crushed the rebellious Saxon spirit and conquered Bavaria.  He unified
the divergent tendencies, but only for a time. In 843 his empire was
partitioned. France grew out of the western portion, Germany out of
the eastern. Lotharingia or Lorraine was established as a middle
kingdom. Did kind Fates design it as a guarantee of peace and
stability?</p>

<p>The Germans are apt to claim for themselves a pure and Valhallic
origin, an exceptionally unmixed descent of the highest
attributes. The primogenial origin may be hidden in obscurity, but the
German people have absorbed Gauls, Serbs, Poles, Wends, and a medley
of Slav and Celtic races which confound all claims to racial
purity. Slavs settled in Teutonic countries and Teutons settled in
Slavonic countries. The German colonists who invaded
<!-- Page 153 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Russia at the invitation of Catherine II were imported to strengthen
Russia, just as the Great Elector helped thousands of Huguenots
fleeing from France to settle in Brandenburg, and gave them the rights
of citizenship for the sake of the vitality which they would impart to
his depopulated country.</p>

<p>The belief in the unalloyed purity of races and the consequent
battles for national exclusiveness seem to be founded on one of those
gigantic illusions which hold humanity captive for centuries. Here, as
elsewhere, knowledge will spell freedom. When we realize that here and
now nations are in course of transformation, that the divisions of the
past are not the divisions of to-day, and that we, despite
conservatism and resistance, are made to serve as ingredients in some
great mixture of to-morrow, momentous questions arise. Are nations
made by war and conquest? Are peoples amalgamated by oppressive
legislation? Do political alliances between States create
international unities?</p>

<p>Such alliances have not in the past caused any organic union. The
nations have met like partners at a ball and danced to the tune of the
dynastic or religious quarrel which
<!-- Page 154 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
happened to be paramount at the time. The grouping of nations in
alliances has simply been a means of more effective prosecution of
military campaigns, a temporary convenience to be discarded when no
longer needed. If the example of the past is to be followed, then
Great Britain, France, Russia, Italy, and America, though holding
hands now, will separate when the war is over, and may find it
necessary to use the same hands for chastizing each other. Alliances
have been political games and devices, useful or useless according to
the shrewdness of their instigators, but of no value in promoting love
between nations. Old-time enemies become friends, and old-time friends
become enemies at the command of the political drill-sergeant. England
was the hereditary enemy of France.  Prussia was the ally of
England. In the war of the Austrian succession, France in alliance
with Prussia fought England and Austria. During the Seven Years War
Prussia, allied to England, fought Austria allied to France. England,
allied to France and Turkey, fought Russia in the Crimea. Turn the
kaleidoscope of history and you see the English driven out of
Normandy, Napoleon defiling Moscow, the Russians attacking
<!-- Page 155 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Montmartre. Any schoolboy, can trace the changing partners in the
grand alliances of the past, or refuse to commit them to memory on
account of the bewildering fluctuations in international
friendship.</p>

<p>A fiery common hate, though acting as a powerful cement for a time,
is no guarantee of durability. Napoleon and the French were hated by
the nations, as Wilhelm and the Germans are hated to-day. Rapacious
designs for hegemony have always brought about a corresponding amount
of defensive unity on the part of those whose independence was
threatened.  Whether it is Spain or France or Germany that dreams of
world-supremacy, the result is international combination. Richelieu
and Bismarck rouse the same resentment. A great hatred cannot by
itself create a lasting unity, for hatred is apt to grow out of bonds,
and, having settled its legitimate prey outside the circle, generally
ends by turning on its neighbours within it.</p>

<p>Who can deny that nations have been made by conquest? Heroic
self-defence, anger, bitter opposition to the violation of liberty,
are of little avail if the psychological factors are favourable to
amalgamation. A few decades,
<!-- Page 156 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
a few centuries, and there is fusion between oppressor and
oppressed. Hence the loyalty of conquered nations to their foreign
masters, at times, when rivals vainly hope for trouble.  Hence the
indisputable fact that many a nation which but a short time ago fought
valiantly for liberty now manifests not only passive resignation, but
positive contentment. If, on the other hand, the psychological factors
do not favour amalgamation, the legacy of resentment and opposition is
handed on from generation to generation and the injury is never
forgiven. Cases of contented acceptance are quoted as evidence of the
ultimate blessings of war by the adherents of the theory that
efficient military measures constitute right. To me they are rather
evidence of the strength and endurance of the pacifying forces in
human life, and of the sovereignty of the greater unities which draw
nations together. If, in spite of the injuries and devastations of
war, it is possible for men to forgive and to labour for the same
social ends, that is surely proof that the peoples erect no barrier to
brotherhood. The truth is, war sometimes achieves that which pacific
settlement and free intercourse always achieve.</p>

<p>History has a cavalier way of recording the benefits of
conquest. The feelings of the great conquered receive scant
consideration. It is enough that after the passage of some centuries
we contemplate the matter and declare the conquest to have been
beneficial. Was not France invigorated by the wild Northmen who
overran her territories and settled wherever they found settlement
advantageous? The Normans, originally pirates and plunderers,
intermingled with the gentler inhabitants of France. When they turned
their eyes to England they were already guardians of civilization. And
we blandly record the Norman conquest of England as an unqualified
benefit, as an impetus to social amenity, art, learning, architecture,
and religion. Protests are useless. The earth abounds in instances of
the spread of knowledge, inventions, culture, through war and
subjugation. The &ldquo;rude&rdquo; peoples who cried out at the
outrage, and who fain would have kept their rudeness, receive no
sympathy from posterity.</p>

<p>This, I repeat, is no argument for the perpetuation of the old ways
of aggression. We have reached a new consciousness and a new
responsibility. We see better ways of spreading
<!-- Page 158 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
the fruits of civilization. In the past ambition and brute force,
hatred and suspicion, fear and deceit, have had full play. In spite of
barbaric warfare and Machiavellian politics the human desire for unity
and co-operation has not been uprooted.</p>

<p>The principle of nationality is emerging from the tortuous
confusion of the ages. We see that it follows no arbitrary rules of
state or empire.  It is a law unto itself: the law of mental
attraction and community. The centres of passionate
nationhood&mdash;Poland, Finland, Ireland&mdash;withstand all attempts
at suppression. You cannot break a strong will to national
independence by sledge-hammer blows. In all the wars of the past
nations have been treated with contemptuous indifference to the wishes
of the people. They were there to be seized and used, invaded and
evacuated at a price, to be bought and sold for some empirical or
commercial consideration. In the treaties of peace, princes and
statesmen tossed countries and populations to each other as if they
had been balls in a game of chance.</p>

<p>A new conception of human dignity and of the inviolability of
natural rights now demands a revaluation of all the motives and
objects
<!-- Page 159 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
for which governments send subjects to battle. Democracy is finding
her international unity. A great many wars of the past are recognized
as having been, not only unnecessary, but positively foolish. The
force of an idea is threatening to dispel the force of arms. The idea
which rises dominant out of the European war is the conviction that
nations have a right to choose their own allegiance or independence;
that there must be freedom instead of compulsion; that real
nationality is a psychological state, a tribute of sympathy, a
voluntary service to which the mind is drawn by affection. To some who
lightly praised the idea, treating it as an admirable prop to war, the
consequences and application will bring dismay. For here you have the
pivot of a social revolution such as the world has never yet seen. It
cannot only remain a question of Belgium, or Serbia, or
Alsace-Lorraine. It will inevitably be retrospective and
prospective. It cannot be limited to the possessions of Germany or
Austria or Turkey. It will not pass over India, South Africa, and
Egypt.  All empires have been extended by conquest of unwilling
nationalities.  Bitter wars have been fought in Europe for colonial
<!-- Page 160 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
supremacy in other continents. The unwilling tribes of Africa, Asia,
and America who have been suppressed or exterminated to make room for
the expanding nations of Europe knew little of the liberty of choice
which has now become the beacon of militant morality. The
principle&mdash;if triumphant&mdash;will be destructive of empire
based on military force. It will be destructive of war, for war is
national compulsion in its most logical and uncompromising form. If
there is nothing and nobody to conquer, if you may not use armies to
widen your national frontiers, or to procure valuable land for
economical exploitation, the incentive to war will be removed. The
principle will be constructive of a commonwealth of nations, and
empires which have achieved a spiritual unity will survive the change
of form.</p>

<p>Nationality may be merely instinctive. It is characterized by the
my-country-right-or-wrong attitude, and knows not the difference
between Beelzebub and Michael. It is primitive and
unreasoning. Nationality may be compulsory&mdash;a sore grievance and
a bitter reproach to existence. It may be a matter of choice, free and
deliberate, a source of joy
<!-- Page 161 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
and social energy. Such nationality&mdash;whether inborn or
acquired&mdash;is the best and safest asset which a State can
possess. It is generally supposed that the naturalized subject must be
disloyal in a case of conflict between his country of adoption and his
country of birth. Such a view assumes that all sense of nationality is
of the primitive and unreasoning kind. It precludes all the
psychological factors of attraction, education, friendship, adoption,
amalgamation. It is ignorant of the fact that some of the bitterest
enemies of Germany are Germans, who have left Germany because they
could stand her no longer.  These men have a much keener knowledge of
her weak spots than the visitors who give romantic accounts in
newspapers of her internal state.  The whole process of naturalization
may be rendered unnecessary and undesirable by future developments in
international co-operation. As things are, it is a formal and legal
confirmation of an allegiance which must exist before the certificate
of citizenship is sought. Once given, the certificate should be
honoured and the oath respected. To treat it as a scrap of paper is
unworthy of a State which upholds constitutional rights. There
<!-- Page 162 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
are doubtless scoundrels amongst naturalized people. It would be
strange if there were not. But to proclaim that a naturalized subject
cannot love the country of his choice as much as the country of his
birth is as rational as the statement that a man cannot love his wife
as much as he loves his mother. Now I have touched on a delicate
point. He may love his wife, but he must repudiate his mother, curse
her, abuse her, disown her. In time of war some do, and some do not. I
am not sure that the deepest loyalty is accompanied by the loudest
curses.</p>

<p>There is a class of people&mdash;I have met them in every
country&mdash;who are devotees of the simple creed that you should
stay at home and not interfere in the affairs of others. Travel you
may, with a Baedeker or a Cook's guide, and stay you may in hotels
provided for the purpose, but you must do it in a proper way and at
proper times, and preserve a strict regard for your national
prerogatives. But you should not go and live in countries which are
not your own. To such people there is something almost indecent in the
thought that any one should deliberately wish to shed his own
nationality and clothe himself in
<!-- Page 163 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
another. They form the unintelligent background against which the wild
and lurid nationalists of every tribe disport themselves in frenzied
movements of hate and antagonism. An irate old colonel (very gouty)
said to me the other day: &ldquo;A man who forgets his duties to his
own country and settles in another is a damnable cur. So much for
these dirty foreigners who overrun England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ventured to remind him that the English have settled in a good
many places: in America, in Australia, in spots fair and foul,
friendly and unfriendly; that they have brought afternoon tea and
sport and Anglican services to the pleasure resorts of Europe and the
deserts of Africa.  Meeting with no response, I embarked on a short
account of the past travels and achievements of the Dutch, the
Spaniards, and the French in the art of settlement in foreign lands. I
ended up by prophesying that the aeroplane of the future will
transport us swiftly from continent to continent and make mincemeat of
the last remnants of our national exclusiveness. He was not in the
least perturbed. &ldquo;That is all rubbish,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;people ought to stick to their own country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am afraid neither he nor anybody else can check the wanderings of
individuals and peoples which have gone on ever since man discovered
that he has two legs with which he can move about. And naturalization,
after all, is an easy way of acquiring new and possibly useful
citizens.  The subjects come willingly, whilst the millions who are
made subjects by war and subjugation are sometimes exceedingly
troublesome. After all, the aim of all the great kingdoms has been to
increase and strengthen the population, and differences of nationality
have been treated as but trifling obstacles in the way. If the
principle of free nationality which is now stirring the world and
inspiring a war of liberation is to triumph, then the liberty won must
include the individuals who prefer a chosen to a compulsory political
allegiance.</p>

<p>Sometimes the forces of attraction and repulsion create strong ties
of sympathy or lead to acts of repudiation which cross frontiers
irrespectively of the indications on the barometer of foreign
politics.  A man may find his spiritual home in the most unexpected
place. He may irresistibly be drawn by the currents of philosophy and
art to a foreign country.

The customs in his own may drive him to bitter denunciation.  No one
has said harder things of Germany than Nietzsche. Schopenhauer wished
it to be known that he despised the German nation on account of its
infinite stupidity, and that he blushed to belong to it. Heine fled
from Germany in intellectual despair. &ldquo;If I were a
German,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;and I am no German....&rdquo; His
heart was captured by the French. Goethe and Frederick the Great were
both profoundly influenced by the French spirit. Voltaire was most
useful at the Prussian Court, for he corrected the voluminous literary
and political output which his Prussian majesty penned&mdash;in
French. But there was something more than mere utility in the tie
between the philosopher and the monarch. Frederick was not only trying
to handle heavy German artillery with light French esprit; his mind
craved for the spices of Gallic wit, his thought was ever striving to
clothe itself in the form of France. Another &ldquo;great&rdquo;
German, Catherine II of Russia, also moved within the orbit of the
French philosophers.</p>

<p>Admiration of Germany and German ways has found the strongest
expression in foreigners,
<!-- Page 166 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
and the megalomania from which her sons suffer to-day may be traced to
such outbursts of adulation. Carlyle, the most representative of
pro-German men of letters in the Victorian era, wrote in 1870:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Alone of nations, Prussia seems still to
understand something of the art of governing, and of fighting enemies
to said art. Germany from of old, has been the peaceablest, most
pious, and in the end most valiant and terriblest of nations. Germany
ought to be the President of Europe, and will again, it seems, be
tried with that office for another five centuries or so.... This is
her <i>first</i> lesson poor France is getting. It is probable she
will require many such.</p></div>

<p>This is blasphemy indeed at the present time. Charles Kingsley was
no less emphatic in his admiration of Germany. Writing on the
Franco-Prussian War to Professor Max Müller, he said:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Accept my loving congratulations, my dear
Max, to you and your people. The day which dear Bunsen used to pray,
with tears in his eyes, might not come till the German people were
ready, has come, and the German people are ready. Verily God is just
and rules too; whatever the Press may think to the contrary. My only
fear is lest the Germans should think of Paris, which cannot concern
them, and turn
<!-- Page 167 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
their eyes away from that which does concern them, the retaking of
Alsace (which is their own), and leaving the Frenchman no foot of the
Rhine-bank. To make the Rhine a word not to be mentioned by the French
henceforth ought to be the one object of wise Germans, and that
alone.... I am full of delight and hope for Germany.</p></div>

<p>And to Sir Charles Bunbury:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>I confess to you that were I a German I
should feel it my duty to my country to send my last son, my last
shilling, and after all my own self, to the war, to get that done
which must be done, done so that it will never need doing again. I
trust that I should be able to put vengeance out of my heart, to
forget all that Germany has suffered for two hundred years past from
that vain, greedy, restless nation, all even which she suffered, women
as well as men, in the late French war.</p></div>

<p>The attraction of Germany is not only paramount in literature, in
Walter Scott and Mill and Matthew Arnold; the superiority of German
blood and constitution was an article of faith of the Victorians. The
sins of Prussia were forgiven with amazing alacrity. The base attacks
on Austria and Denmark evoked no moral indignation. German influence
on English life was not only welcomed; historians went so far as to
proclaim the identity of
<!-- Page 168 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
England and Germany. Thus Freeman, in a lecture in 1872, stated that
&ldquo;what is Teutonic in us is not merely one element among others,
but that it is the very life and essence of our national
being....&rdquo; Houston Chamberlain, in his reverent unravelling of
the greatness of the Germanic peoples, is merely carrying on the
tradition of the Victorian age. In the application of theories he is a
disciple of Gobineau, a Frenchman, who after a profound study of the
inequality of the human race became convinced of the superiority and
high destiny of Germany. Gobineau and Chamberlain have told the
Germans that they are mighty and unconquerable, and the Germans have
listened with undisguised pleasure.</p>

<p>Gobineau may be set aside as a professor of a fixed idea. There are
other Frenchmen who have paid glowing tribute to Germany. Taine
excelled in praise of her intellectual vigour and productivity. Victor
Hugo expressed his love and admiration for her people, and confessed
to an almost filial feeling for the noble and holy fatherland of
thinkers. If he had not been French he would have liked to have been
German. Ernest Renan studied Germany, and found her like a
temple&mdash;so
<!-- Page 169 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
pure, so moral, so touching in her beauty. This reminds us of the many
who during the present war, though ostensibly enemies of Germany,
spend half their time in proclaiming her perfection and the necessity
for immediate imitation of all her ways. Madame de Staël and Michelet
expressed high regard for German character and institutions. There are
degrees and qualities of attraction and absorption, varying from the
amorous surrender with which Lafcadio Hearn took on Japanese form to
the bootlicking flattery which Sven Hedin heaps on the Germans. (It is
quite futile to seek for an explanation of Hedin's conduct in his
Jewish-Prussian descent. He would lackey anywhere. Strindberg dealt
faithfully with Hedin's pretensions.  Strindberg, alas! is dead, but
his exposure of Hedin has been strangely justified.)</p>

<p>Heine is an example of the curious and insistent fascination with
which the mind may be drawn to one nationality whilst it is repelled
by another. His judgment on England is painful in the extreme:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is eight years since I went to London,&rdquo; he writes
in the Memoirs, &ldquo;to make the acquaintance of the language and
the people. The
<!-- Page 170 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
devil take the people and their language! They take a dozen words of
one syllable into their mouth, chew them, gnaw them, spit them out
again, and they call that talking. Fortunately they are by nature
rather silent, and although they look at us with gaping mouths, yet
they spare us long conversations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Can anything be more sweeping? Can anything be more untrue?
&ldquo;Fortunately they are by nature rather
silent&rdquo;&mdash;imagine the reversed verdict had Heine attended a
general election campaign! The unattractiveness of England is softened
by the women. &ldquo;If I can leave England alive, it will not be the
fault of the women; they do their best.&rdquo; This is praise indeed,
when placed side by side with his dismissal of the women of
Hamburg. They are plump, we are told, &ldquo;but the little god Cupid
is to blame, who often sets the sharpest of love's darts to his bow,
but from naughtiness or clumsiness shoots too low, and hits the women
of Hamburg not in the heart but in the stomach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>France was as delightful as England was doleful:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor sensitive soul,&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;that often
recoiled in shyness from German coarseness,
<!-- Page 171 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
opened out to the flattering sounds of French urbanity. God gave us
our tongues so that we might say pleasant things to our
fellow-men.... Sorrows are strangely softened. In the air of Paris
wounds are healed quicker than anywhere else; there is something so
noble, so gentle, so sweet in the air as in the people
themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I suppose the only analogy to such superlative contentment is
provided by the phenomenon known as falling in love. Happily we do not
all choose the same object of affection. England has a curious way of
inspiring either great and lasting love or irritation and positive
dislike. There seems to be little or no indifference. I believe love
predominates.</p>

<p>From exiled kings to humble refugees, from peripatetic philosophers
to indolent aborigines, the testimony of her charm can be gathered. I
speak as a victim. I love England with a fervour born of admiration
(without admiration no one ever falls in love). I love her ways and
her mind, I love her chilly dampness and her hot, glowing fires
(attempts to analyse and classify love are always silly). In her
thinkers and workers, in her schemes and efforts for social
improvement, in her
<!-- Page 172 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
freedom of thought and speech I found my mental <i>milieu</i>.</p>

<p>To me England is inexpressibly dear, not because a whole conspiracy
of influences&mdash;educational, conventional, patriotic&mdash;were at
work persuading me that she is worthy of affection. I myself
discovered her lovableness. Your Chauvinist is always a mere
repeater. He is but a member of the Bandar-Log, shouting greatness of
which he knows nothing.  True love does not need the trumpets of
Jingoism. I have no room for lies about England: the truth is
sufficient for me. Though I love England, I have affection to spare
for other countries. I feel at home in France, in Sweden, in America,
in Switzerland. Your Chauvinist will excuse the former affections on
account of &ldquo;blood.&rdquo; Swedish-French by ties of ancestry,
such a sense of familiarity is natural when set against my
preternatural love of England.</p>

<p>Chauvinism flourishes exceedingly on the soil of national
conceit. That conceit is prodigious and universal. The Germans are
past-masters in the art of self-glorification, and their pan-German
literature is certainly not only bold but ingenious in this respect.
<!-- Page 173 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Is any one great outside Germany? Very well, let us trace his German
origin. It may be remote, it may be hidden by centuries of illusory
nationality, but it must be there. France has her apostles of
superiority. Their style is more flexible, their pretensions less
clumsy, but they neglect no opportunity of seducing us into a belief
that France, and France only, is mistress of the human mind. Russia
has her fervid declaimers of holy excellence and the superior quality
of the Slav character. It does not matter whether the country is great
or small, whether it be Montenegro or Cambodia, it always contains
souls who feel constrained to give the world a demonstration of their
overflowing superiority. Pan-Germanism, pan-Slavism, pan-Magyarism,
pan-Anglosaxism, pan-Americanism grow out of such conceit,
systematized by professors and sanctified by bishops.</p>

<p>The conceit of nationality often fosters great deeds, and generally
finds expression that is more aggressive than intelligent. It takes
hold of the most unlikely subjects. It is a potent destroyer of
balanced judgment, and will pitilessly make the most solemn men
ridiculous. The outbursts of Emerson when
<!-- Page 174 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
under its influence are truly amazing. &ldquo;If a temperate wise man
should look over our American society,&rdquo; he said in a lecture,
&ldquo;I think the first danger which would excite his alarm would be
the European influences on this country.... See the secondariness and
aping of foreign and English life that runs through this country, in
building, in dress, in eating, in books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This rejection savours of the contempt with which some young men
turn their backs on the fathers who fashioned them. &ldquo;Let the
passion for America,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;cast out the passion for
Europe. Here let there be what the earth waits for&mdash;exalted
manhood.&rdquo; He gives a picture of the finished man, the gentleman
who will be born in America. He defines the superiority of such a man
to the Englishman:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Freer swing his arms; farther pierce his
eyes, more forward and forthright his whole build and rig than the
Englishman's, who, we see, is much imprisoned in his
backbone.</p></div>

<p>It is difficult to surmise the exact meaning of being imprisoned in
one's backbone. The possession of plenty of backbone is generally held
to be a decided advantage. Emerson
<!-- Page 175 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
may have had special and transcendental prejudices against strongly
fashioned vertebræ.</p>

<p>The freaks of nationalism are as remarkable as the freaks of
internationalism. There is a constant interplay between the two, and
the ascendancy of the one or the other often seems strangely
capricious.  Nationalism is weak where it should be strong, and rigid
where common sense would make it fluid. The painful position of most
royal families in time of war is an example of the readiness with
which nations submit to foreign rulership and influence. Thrones, one
would think, should represent the purely national spirit in its more
intimate and sacred aspect. Yet the abundance of crowned rulers, past
and present, attached by solemn selection or marriage, who are not by
blood and tradition of the people, shows the fallacy of this
supposition. Napoleon was an Italian who learnt French with some
difficulty, and who was at first hostile to the French and somewhat
contemptuous of their ways. Maréchal Bernadotte&mdash;French to his
finger-tips&mdash;became King of Sweden. Pierre Loti, interviewing the
charming and beloved Queen of the Belgians during the present war,
remembers that the martyred lady before him
<!-- Page 176 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
is a Bavarian princess. The delicate and painful subject is
mentioned. &ldquo;It is at an end,&rdquo; says the Queen;
&ldquo;between <i>them</i> and me has fallen a curtain of iron which
will never again be lifted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prominent statesmen, who, one would also think, should be bone of
the bone of the nations for which they speak, have often been of alien
birth or of mixed racial composition. Bismarck was of Slav origin;
Beaconsfield was a Jew. The most picturesque example of such
irregularities of the national consciousness is perhaps the presence
of General Smuts in the War Cabinet. Once the alert and brave enemy in
arms against this country, he is now its trusted guide, philosopher,
and friend.</p>

<p>Writers whom posterity classes as typical representatives of the
national genius have often been of mixed racial strain, as were
Tennyson, Browning, Ibsen, Kant, Victor Hugo, Dumas, Longfellow, and
Whitman. The &ldquo;bastards&rdquo; of internationalism, so offensive
to some nationalist fire-eaters, are not produced by the simple and
natural processes by which races are mixed. They are self-created,
their minds are set on gathering the varied fruit of all the
nations. Genealogically they may be
<!-- Page 177 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
as uninteresting as the snail in the cabbage-patch, spiritually they
are provocative and arresting. Romain Rolland and George Brandes
challenge and outrage the champions of nationalism by the very texture
of their minds. Joseph Conrad, a Pole, stands side by side with Thomas
Hardy in his mastership of contemporary English fiction.  Conrad in
his consummate interpretation of sea-life is, if anything, more
English than Hardy.</p>

<p>The future of internationalism is possibly fraught with greater
wonders than has been the past. The path will certainly not be laid
out with the smoothness which some enthusiasts imagine. The idea and
the hope are old as the hills. Cicero proclaimed a universal society
of the human race.  Seneca declared the world to be his
country. Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius declared themselves citizens of
the world. St. Paul explained that there is neither Jew nor
Greek. John Wesley looked upon the world as his parish. &ldquo;The
world is my country, mankind are my brothers,&rdquo; said Thomas
Paine. &ldquo;The whole world being only one city,&rdquo; said
Goldsmith, &ldquo;I do not care in which of the streets I happen to
reside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such complete impartiality is a little too
<!-- Page 178 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
detached for the make-up of present humanity. It may suit an
etherialized and mobile race of the future. We are dependent on
conditions of space and surroundings, we are the creatures of
association and love. The master-problem in internationalism is the
elimination of the forces of prejudice and ignorance that foster
hostility, and the preservation of the precious characteristics which
are the riches of the Soul of the World.</p>

<p>The general destructiveness of war is patent to everybody. The
destruction of life, of property, of trade, strikes the most
superficial observer as inevitable consequences of a state of war. At
the outbreak of hostilities most of us foresaw that the uprooting
would not stop short at the sacrifices of livelihood and occupation
which were demanded by military necessities. We expected a sweeping
revision of our habits, our prejudices, our conventions. We have got
infinitely more than we expected. Not only have we made acquaintance
with the State&mdash;the State as a relentless master of human fate
and service; not only have we learnt that
individualism&mdash;philosophic or commercial&mdash;is borne like a
bubble on the waters of national tribulation and counts for nothing in
the mass of collective effort demanded from us. Industry, commerce,
art, learning, science, energy, enthusiasm, every gift and power
within the range of human capacity, is

requisitioned for the efficient pursuit of war. Liberty of action, of
speech, ancient rights which were won by centuries of struggle, are
taken away because we are more useful and less troublesome without
them. We are made parts of the machinery of State, and we have to be
drilled and welded into the proper shape.</p>

<p>The changes imposed on us from without are thorough and have been
surprisingly many, but the changes taking place within our own souls
are deeper and likely to surprise us more in the end. Everything has
been found untenable. Theories and systems are shaken by the great
upheaval.  Civilization has become a question instead of a
postulate. All human thought is undergoing a process of retrospection,
drawn by a desire to find a new and stable beginning. Take down
Spencer and Comte or Lecky and Kidd from your bookshelf and try to
settle down to a contented contemplation of the sociological tenets of
the past. You will fail, for you will feel that this is a new world
with burning problems and compelling facts which cannot be covered by
the old systems. Take down the old books of religious
comfort&mdash;Thomas à Kempis, or Bunyan, or St.  Augustine, and you
feel their remoteness from the new
<!-- Page 181 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
agonies of soul.  But it is not only the old books of piety which fail
to satisfy the hunger of to-day; the mass of devotional writings,
especially produced to meet the needs of the war, are painfully
inadequate. Rightly or wrongly, there is a sense of the inadequacy of
the thought of the past to meet the need of the present. It invades
every recess of the mind, it interposes itself in science as well as
in religion; it leaves us no peace.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt about it: we are blighted by the great
destructiveness. All attempts to keep the war from our thoughts are
destined to fail. Without being struck in an air-raid or torpedoed on
the high seas, there is a sufficiency of destructive force in the
daily events and in our accommodation to live on for them or in spite
of them.</p>

<p>Hence the universal demand for reconstruction. It is a blessed
word: we cling to it, we live by it. So many buildings have tumbled
about our ears, so many foundations were nothing but running sand; a
whole galaxy of truths turned out to be lies. Now we must prepare that
which is solid and indestructible. Perhaps some great and wise spirit
brooding over our world, learned with the experience of
<!-- Page 182 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
æons, of human attempts and mistakes, smiles at the deadly earnestness
of the intention to reconstruct. I do not care. We have reached a pass
when all life and all hope are centred in this faith: the faith that
we can make anew and good and beautiful the distorted web of human
existence.</p>

<p>The war has not taught us what civilization is. But it has taught
us what it is not. We know now that it is not mechanical ingenuity or
clever inventions or commercialism carried to its utmost perfection.
Civilization is not railways or telephones or vast cities or material
prosperity. A satisfactory definition of civilization is well-nigh
impossible. The past has born a bewildering number of different types,
and it is a matter of personal taste where we place the line of
demarcation between barbarism and culture. Our Christian civilization
is passing through catastrophic changes, and it is again a matter of
opinion whether it is in its death-throes or in the pangs of a new
birth. But we feel vaguely, yet insistently, that civilization is a
state of the soul; it is the gentle life towards which we aspire. It
is based on the gradual substitution of moral and spiritual forces for
<!-- Page 183 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
simple brute force. What is the exact relation of religion to
civilization? The answer has been as variable as the purpose of the
questioners. To some religion is civilization, to others it is merely
a temporary weakness of the human mind, to which it will always be
prone from fear of the unknown and the wish to live for
ever. Comparative studies of the great religions of the world, their
past and present forms, do not support the view that civilization is
identical with religion. Religions have on many occasions ranged
themselves on the side of brute force to the suppression of gentleness
and sympathetic tolerance. It is really all a question of the meaning
which we attach to the word &ldquo;religion.&rdquo; Do we mean the
Church, set forms of worship and ceremonial, or do we mean the human
craving for spiritual truth with the consequent strife to reach
certainty, and, in certainty, peace of soul?  There is a gulf between
the two conceptions of religion.</p>

<p>Religion is questioned as never heretofore. The great
destructiveness is passing over the old beliefs. In the clamour for
reconstruction we must clearly distinguish between the wider religious
life and mere denominationalism.</p>

<p>The vast host of rationalists are busy proclaiming
<!-- Page 184 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
the downfall of religion. The war serves them as material for
demonstration. The failure of Christianity to avert bloodshed, and the
horrors under which Christendom is now submerged, are naturally used
as a proof that the ethic of Christianity is lamentably feeble. The
difference between theoretical Christianity and the social practices
which the Church condones is held to be damning evidence of hypocrisy
and falsehood. The quarrels between sects and divisions, the petty
subjects which rouse the ire of the orthodox mind, the persistent
quibbling over insignificant details of faith and service, have
strained rationalistic patience to the breaking-point. The Church has
been found fiddling whilst Rome burns.</p>

<p>Our little rationalists are right, perfectly right, when they point
to the shortcomings of the Churches. But they confuse the form with
the substance, the frailties of human nature with the irrepressible
desire to find God. They have their small idols and their conventional
forms of worship, which, if put to the great social test, would prove
as ineffective in building the City of Light as the churchgoing of the
past. Their prime deity is Science. We are on the point of developing
intelligence, they tell us;
<!-- Page 185 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
we at last see through the silly theories about God and the Universe,
which deluded the childish and the ignorant of past ages. Assisted by
the sound of guns and the sight of general misery, we must at last
realize that there is no God to interfere in the troubles of man, and
that Churches and creeds are hopeless failures.  Science, we are
assured, will take the place of religion.</p>

<p>I am a patient and sympathetic student of the propagandist
literature of rationalism. I have the greatest admiration for the
moral and social idealism which is advocated. I agree that the
atheological moral idea is superior to the mere performance of
religious ceremonial. But I cannot admire the reasoning or the
intelligence of those who use a smattering of science as evidence of
the decay of religion. There is something almost comical in the
solemnity with which they contrast the commonplaces of scientific
observation with the vast mysteries of religion, to the detriment of
the latter. &ldquo;These marvellous researches of the human
eye,&rdquo; writes Sir Harry Johnston in a collection of articles
entitled <i>A Generation of Religious Progress</i>, presumably
intended to portray our rationalistic progress, &ldquo;so far,
<!-- Page 186 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
though they have sounded the depths of the Universe, have found no
God.&rdquo; He is speaking of astronomical investigation, and he has
just emphasized the reliability of our five senses.</p>

<p>One wonders whether he is simply echoing the well-known phrase of
Laplace, or whether he seriously believes that the non-existence of
God is proved by the inability of the human eye to see Him! Nothing
could be more unscientific&mdash;one hates using that hackneyed
expression, but there is no other&mdash;than this confidence in the
reliability of the senses. It reminds one of the young man who said he
could not believe in God because he had not seen Him. He could only
believe in things which he could see. &ldquo;Do you believe you have a
brain?&rdquo; some one asked. The young man did. &ldquo;And have you
seen it?&rdquo; was the next question.</p>

<p>I shall be told that though the young man could
not&mdash;fortunately&mdash;see his own brain, others might by opening
his skull, and that no dissection of brains or examination of stars
has ever shown us God. This is exactly the point where our easygoing
rationalist misses the mark. Brains and stars do show God to those who
<!-- Page 187 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
have developed the faculties wherewith to perceive Him.</p>

<p>The senses are, after all, very fallible and very variable. A
little opium, a little alcohol, a blow on the head, or some great
emotion will modify their judgment to an incredible degree. Sir Harry
Johnston may not be very representative as an exponent of scientific
conclusions about the existence of God, but he is interesting and
typical of much of the rough-and-ready opposition to formulated
religion. I quote the upshot of his admiration for the feats of the
human eye:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Religion, as the conception of a heavenly
being, or heavenly beings, hovering about the earth and concerning
themselves greatly with the affairs of man, has been abolished for all
thoughtful and educated people by the discoveries of science. Perhaps,
however, I should not say &ldquo;abolished&rdquo; as being too final;
I should prefer to say that such theories have been put entirely in
the background as unimportant Compared with the awful problems which
affect the welfare and progress of humanity on this planet.</p></div>

<p>The honesty of the conviction is not marred by the fact that it is
entirely mistaken. &ldquo;God is infinitely more remote now (in 1916)
from the thoughts of the educated few than he was prior to
1859,&rdquo; writes Sir Harry. This statement
<!-- Page 188 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
is not true. Speculation about God, the meaning of life, the social
import of Christianity, was never more rife amongst educated
people. Here I must check myself: what does &ldquo;educated&rdquo;
mean? To be able to read and write, and say &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo;
at public meetings? To have a pretty idea of the positions of Huxley
and Haeckel by which to confound the poor old Bible? If by education
we mean the exposition of some special branch of the physical
sciences, the statement may be true.  If we mean men and women with a
general knowledge of life and letters, with a social consciousness and
humanitarian sympathies, it is ridiculously wide of the truth. There
is everywhere a hunger for a satisfying explanation of life. There are
restlessness and impatience with dogma and creed, there is a growing
indifference to the old sectarian exclusiveness, but there is above
all a new interest in God.  We need not go to Mr. Bernard Shaw or
Mr. Wells for testimony to this interest. They reflect the religious
renaissance which is the essence of the reconstruction for which men
crave. The symptoms are accessible to the observation of all. Neither
priestly intolerance nor rationalistic prejudice can suppress
them.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 189 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
</div>

<p>In <i>The Bankruptcy of Religion</i>, Mr. Joseph McCabe develops
the case against religion with the skill of a trained
controversialist. Like the converted sinner in the ranks of the
Salvation Army, Mr. McCabe carries special weight to the lines of
rationalists and ethicists. For he was once a priest and lived in a
monastery, and he left the priesthood and the monastery convinced of
the worthlessness of both. He is, therefore, <i>persona gratissima</i>
at the High Court of Reason. &ldquo;The era of religious influence
closes in bankruptcy,&rdquo; he informs us. He has no patience with
attempts at religious reconstruction; he asks us to shake ourselves
free of the vanishing dream of heaven and to leave the barren tracts
of religion. He exhorts us to abandon the &ldquo;last illusions of the
childhood of the race&rdquo;:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Linger no longer in the
&ldquo;reconstruction&rdquo; of fables which once beguiled the Arabs
of the desert and the Syrian slaves of Corinth, but set your hearts
and minds to the making of a new earth! Sweep these ancient legends
out of your schools and colleges, your army and navy, your code of
law, your legislative houses, and substitute for them a spirit of
progress, efficiency, boldness, and candour!</p></div>

<p>Fine words, brave words, honest words, but hollow
within. Mr. McCabe is no psychologist.
<!-- Page 190 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
The fables and legends of old times may be abandoned, the desire for
the realities round which fable and legend grow remains and cannot be
extirpated by a rationalistic operation.  Supernaturalism&mdash;in the
widest sense&mdash;is ineradicable. Religion will not be suspended by
the discovery that it is possible to formulate excellent theories of
social equity without the assistance of priests. The hunger of the
human heart for knowledge of God persists though all the old religious
systems may prove illusions.</p>

<p>Our little rationalists imagine that they are hitting the
foundations of religion when they successfully assail the crumbling
walls of dogmas.  Religious life escapes their fire. Faith and hope
rise above disillusionment. Love knows instinctively that it is not
made of dust.  Through the darkness and the wilderness it calls to
God, and lo! God responds with light and guidance which outlast
earthquakes and massacres. Reject every creed that has been offered as
an explanation of the mysteries of life, forsake all the humiliating,
joy-killing penances for sin, and God will reveal Himself in the
beauty of Nature. He will speak through the impulses of creative art,
through music and poetry and painting. He will
<!-- Page 191 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
attract our thought through philosophy and our emotion through the
impetus to improve the social order. And science&mdash;the greater
science, which rejects dogmatism and lies of self-sufficiency as it
rejects the crudities of the Creed&mdash;takes us by circuitous paths
to new temples for the worship of God.</p>

<p>The tenet that science and religion are incompatible and
antagonistic, so dear to the hearts of the scientists in the middle of
the nineteenth century, and still repeated with mechanical certainty
in every secularist mission-hall, is likely to undergo a complete
revision in the near future. The antagonism between dogmatic religion
and materialistic science will never be removed. But the signs are
apparent everywhere that religion is shedding its adherence to outer
forms and entering into the freedom of the living spirit, whilst
science is turning to problems which used to lie within the domain of
unexplored religion. Religion will become scientific and science will
become religious. The principles laid down by Darwin and Huxley have
lost their power of stifling religious aspiration; the startling
pronouncements in defiant materialism of Büchner and Haeckel now
startle none but the ignorant.  The
<!-- Page 192 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
anxiety to exclude scientific facts disappears with the realization
that all truth, all knowledge, all reason, are subservient to the
search for God. The struggle between the wish to believe and the
temptation to think caused real distress of mind to many thinkers of
the nineteenth century. The choice seemed to lie between atheism and
blind submission to authority. &ldquo;Let us humbly take anything the
Bible says without trying to understand it, and not torment ourselves
with arguments,&rdquo; said Charles Kingsley. &ldquo;One word of
Scripture is more than a hundred words of man's explaining.&rdquo; The
modern mind does not dread the meeting of science and religion. It
does not labour to reconcile them. It is conscious of their ultimate
identity and their present insufficiency. Hence a new tolerance which
is mistaken for indifference by the zealots on both sides. Hence the
absence of actuality in the fierce denunciations of Bradlaugh and
Holyoake and Ingersoll. They did valiant battle against religious
formalism of the past; they were champions of reason and science at a
time when religionists fought to exclude both.</p>

<p>It is not science which is undermining the future of institutional
religion. There is a new
<!-- Page 193 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
enemy, more subtle and more powerful. It is the growing consciousness
of an intolerable inconsistency between religious theory and
practice. The war thus becomes a stumbling-block to faithfulness to
conventional Christianity, and the glee of the rationalist is
pardonable. I again quote Mr. McCabe:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>What did the clergy do to prevent the
conflict? In which country did they denounce the preparations for the
conflict, or the incentives of the conflict? What have they done since
it began to confine the conflict within civilized limits? Have they
had, or used, a particle of moral influence throughout the whole
bloody business? And, if not, is it not time we found other guardians
and promoters of high conduct?</p></div>

<p>Apart from the fact that the Pope and some lesser religious leaders
have denounced and deplored the conflict, and that a comprehensive
answer to Mr. McCabe's question would somewhat modify the implied
moral impotence of the clergy, we might ask the same questions of the
leaders of secularist morality. What have they done to prevent the
conflict? Why have their intellectual giants failed to impress upon
mankind the folly of war? They have had freedom of speech and action,
they have
<!-- Page 194 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
wielded incisive criticism and strength of invective. They have had
many decades in which to put into practice the theory of the greatest
happiness of the greatest number. But the problem of the persistence
of war has somehow escaped atheists and rationalists, just as it has
eluded theologians and revivalists.</p>

<p>We may admit that the clergy are more blameworthy than the orators
of rationalism. If the teachings of Jesus Christ are to be applied to
the art of war, then the art of war is doomed to extinction. If the
Church be an international society, based on mutual love and peace,
then the perpetration of war on members of the Church is clearly
wrong. If the ideals of the Christian life be charity, gentleness,
forgiveness, non-resistance to evil, then all war is a violation of
the faith. The question is not unimportant. It is not a subject which
you can toy with, or put aside as having no immediate bearing on life
and duty. If the literal application of the teaching of Christ to
social and political life be impossible, then the rationalists are
right when they urge us to drop a religion which we profess on Sunday
and repudiate on Monday. If the fault lies not in the teaching itself
but in the feebleness of the Church, then the Church
<!-- Page 195 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
must clearly be counted a failure. If the cause of the discrepancy is
to be found merely in the slowness and obstinacy of the human soul in
following the path of righteousness, the practical realization of the
Christian ideal will be but a question of time and effort.</p>

<p>The attitude of Christianity towards war may at best be described
as a chapter of inconsistencies. &ldquo;Can it be lawful to handle the
sword,&rdquo; asked Tertullian, &ldquo;when the Lord Himself has
declared that he who uses the sword shall perish by it?&rdquo; By
disarming Peter, he stated, the Lord &ldquo;disarmed every soldier
from that time forward.&rdquo; To Origen, Christians were children of
peace who, for the sake of Jesus, shunned the temptations of war, and
whose only weapon was prayer. The difficulty of reconciling the
profession of Christianity with the practice of war constantly
exercised the minds of the early Christians. St. Basil advocated a
compromise in the form of temporary exclusion from the sacrament after
military service. St. Augustine came to the conclusion that the
qualities of a good Christian and a good warrior were not
incompatible. Gradually the dilemma ceased to trouble the minds of
Christians as the needs of the State and citizenship of this
<!-- Page 196 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
world were recognized. After some centuries the Church not only
approved of war, but herself became one of the most powerful
instigators to military conquest. The Crusades and the ceaseless wars
of religious intolerance became &ldquo;holy&rdquo; as the spiritual
objection to bloodshed receded before the triumphant demands of
primitive passions.</p>

<p>Now, as heretofore, we have episcopal reminders of the blessings of
war.  &ldquo;May it not be,&rdquo; wrote the Bishop of London soon
after the outbreak of the war in 1914, &ldquo;that this cup of
hardship which we drink together will turn out to be the very draught
which we need? Has there not crept a softness over the nation, a
passion for amusement, a love of luxury among the rich, and of mere
physical comfort among the middle class?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leaves the questions unanswered, and incidentally omits to dwell
on the shortcomings of the poor in the direction of softness and
luxury. He continues:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>Not such was the nation which made the
Empire, which crushed the Armada, which braved hardships of old, and
drove English hearts of oak seaward round the world. We believe the
old spirit is here just the same, but it needed a purifying, cleansing
<!-- Page 197 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
draught to bring it back to its old strength and purity again, and for
that second reason the cup which our Father has given us, shall we not
drink it?</p></div>

<p>Much has been said in justification of this view of war from the
biological point of view. Prussian militarists are experts in the
exposition of similar theories. But from the Christian point of view
the complacency with which the world-tragedy is put down as a
&ldquo;purifying, cleansing draught&rdquo; is somewhat
disconcerting. Dean Inge, writing in the <i>Quest</i> in the autumn of
1914, shows himself to be a disciple of the same school:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>We see the fruits of secularism or
materialism in social disintegration, in the voluntary sterility and
timorous acquisitiveness of the prosperous, and in the recklessness
and bitterness of the lower strata. A godless civilization is a
disease of which nations die by inches. I hope that this visitation
has come just in time to save us. Experience is a good school, but its
fees are terribly high!</p></div>

<p>Were we, then, really so bad that &ldquo;this visitation&rdquo; was
needed to save us from voluntary sterility (by imposing compulsory?)
and the other delinquencies enumerated by the Dean? The nature of the
punishment hardly fits the crime. Moreover, such a conception of war
as
<!-- Page 198 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span> a
wholesome corrective is practically indistinguishable from the
panegyrics of the extreme militarists whom we are out utterly to
destroy. &ldquo;God will see to it,&rdquo; wrote Treitschke,
&ldquo;that war always recurs as a drastic medicine for the human
race.&rdquo; &ldquo;War,&rdquo; wrote General von Bernhardi, &ldquo;is
a biological necessity of the first importance, a regulative element
in the life of mankind which cannot be dispensed with, since without
it an unhealthy development will follow which excludes every
advancement of the race, and, therefore, all real civilization.&rdquo;
&ldquo;A perpetual peace,&rdquo; said Field-Marshal von Moltke,
&ldquo;is a dream, and not even a beautiful dream. War is one of the
elements of order in the world established by God. The noblest virtues
of men are developed therein. Without war the world would degenerate
and disappear in a morass of materialism.&rdquo; Many perplexed souls
have turned to the Church for guidance during this time of destruction
and sorrow, and the directions given have often increased the
perplexity. The Bishop of Carlisle expressed the opinion that if we
were really Christians the war would not have happened. Archdeacon
Wilberforce and Father Bernard Vaughan stated that killing Germans was
doing service
<!-- Page 199 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
to God. Many who have suffered at the hands of the Germans will be
inclined to agree, but the trouble from the point of view of the
Christian ethic is not removed by such a simple solution. We cannot
but suspect that German prelates have been found who have seen in the
killing of women and children by air-raids on London a service to the
German God. Dr. Forsyth, in <i>The Christian Ethic of War</i>, tells
us that &ldquo;war is not essentially killing, and killing is here no
murder. And no recusancy to bear arms can here justify itself on the
plea that Christianity forbids all bloodshed or even violence.&rdquo;
He reminds us that Christ used a scourge of small cords, and that he
called the Pharisees &ldquo;you vipers,&rdquo; and Herod &ldquo;you
fox.&rdquo; &ldquo;If the Christian man live in society,&rdquo; he
tells us, &ldquo;it is quite impossible for him to live upon the
<i>precepts</i> of the Sermon on the Mount. But also it is not
possible at a half-developed stage to live in actual relations of life
and duty on its <i>principle</i> except as an <i>ideal</i>.&rdquo; The
Roman form of internationalism he regards &ldquo;as not only useless
to humanity (which the present attitude of the Pope to the war shows)
but as mischievous to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is strange that whilst the war has caused
<!-- Page 200 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
a number of ordained representatives of the Christian Church to
declare that practical Christianity is an impossibility and the Sermon
on the Mount a beautiful but ineffective ideal, it has brought
agnostics and heathen to a conviction that socialized Christianity is
the sovereign remedy for the national and international disease. They
have reached the conclusion that the ethic of the Sermon on the Mount
is the revolutionary leaven for which the world is waiting. In his
preface on <i>The Prospects of Christianity</i>, Mr. Bernard Shaw
tells us that he is &ldquo;as sceptical and scientific and modern a
thinker as you will find anywhere.&rdquo; This assurance is intended
to help us to regain breath after the preceding pronouncement:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>I am no more a Christian than Pilate was, or
you, gentle reader; and yet, like Pilate, I greatly prefer Jesus to
Annas and Caiaphas; and I am ready to admit that after contemplating
the world and human nature for nearly sixty years, I see no way out of
the world's misery but the way which would have been found by Christ's
will if He had undertaken the work of a modern practical
statesman.</p></div>

<p>This is one of the outstanding mental phenomena of the war:
sceptics and thinkers have
<!-- Page 201 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
begun to examine Christianity as a practical way of social
salvation. There is a tendency to re-examine the gospel, not with
intent to lay stress on historical weakness or points of similarity
with other religions, but with the poignant interest which men lost in
the desert display towards possible sources of water. It may appear as
a coldly intellectual interest in some who are wont to deal with the
tragedies of life as mildly amusing scenes in a drama of endless
fatuity. But the coldness is a little assumed. There are others who do
not attempt to disguise that their whole emotional life is stirred to
passionate protest and inquiry, who, though Christians by profession
and duly appointed ministers of God, call for a recommendation of
Christianity and the establishment of a social order based on the
principles of life laid down by Jesus Christ. In <i>The Outlook for
Religion</i>, Dr. W. E. Orchard condemns the way of war as the
complete antithesis of the way of the Cross. &ldquo;How can people be
so blind?&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;Has all the ethical awakening of the
past century been of so little depth that this bloody slaughter, this
hellish torture, this treacherous game of war can still secure ethical
approval?&rdquo;
<!-- Page 202 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the great majority of the clergy deserve the indictment of
rationalists. Mr. McCabe can prove his case by citing the exceptions.
After all, the accusation is neither new nor original. Voltaire set
the tune. &ldquo;Miserable physicians of souls,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;you declaim for five quarters of an hour against the mere
pricks of a pin, and say no word on the curse which tears us into a
thousand pieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Voltaire's powers of satire were roused by the spectacle of the
different factions of Christians praying to the same God to bless
their arms. The element of comicality in this aspect of war is greatly
outweighed by that of pathos. Those who earnestly pray to God to lead
them to victory must at any rate be firmly convinced that their cause
is one of which God can approve. No believer would dare to invoke the
blessing of God upon a cause which his conscience tells him is a mean
and sordid enterprise. Voltaire's quarrel was really with the faith in
war as a means of determining the intentions of the Divine
Will. Success in war has been held, and is held, by Christians to be a
sign of the favour of the Almighty. Bacon expounded this view to the
satisfaction of coming generations when he referred to wars as
&ldquo;the highest trials of
<!-- Page 203 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
right&rdquo; when princes and States &ldquo;shall put themselves on
the justice of God for the deciding of their controversies, by such
success as it shall please Him to give on either side.&rdquo; The
Germans have nauseated the world by their incessant proclamations that
they are the favoured and chosen of God. The good old German God has
vied with Jehovah of the Israelites in stimulating and sustaining the
will to war.</p>

<p>Those atheists to whom all war is an abomination and entirely
irreconcilable with the highest human attributes have found complete
unanimity in their repudiation of the idea of a presiding God of
Battles in the dissenting objections to war expressed by Quakers,
Christadelphians, Plymouth Brethren, and other sects of Christianity.
There can be no doubt that the faith in war, and in the Divine
guidance of war, is receding. The new conception of God, for which
humanity is struggling, will be one entirely different from the
jealous and cruel Master of Bloodshed to whom man has paid homage in
the dark ages of the past. The truth is that the spiritual objection
to war, the realization of its antisocial and inhuman qualities, is
becoming a religious purpose which unites
<!-- Page 204 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Christians and non-Christians, atheists and agnostics, and which
carries with it at once a mordant condemnation of the interpretations
of the past, and an irrepressible demand for a future free from the
old menace and the old mistakes. All sane men and women want to
abolish war. General Smuts believes that a passion for peace has been
born which will prove stronger than all the passion for war which has
overwhelmed us in the past. President Wilson seeks a peace identical
with the freedom of life in which every people will be left free to
determine its own polity and its own way of development,
&ldquo;unhindered, unthreatened, unafraid, the little along with the
great and powerful.&rdquo; Statesmen see the ultimate hope for a free
humanity in a change of heart. Mr. Asquith outlines the slow and
gradual process by which a real European partnership, based on the
recognition of equal right and established and enforced by a common
will, will be substituted for force, for the clash of competing
ambition, for groupings and alliances, and a precarious
equipoise. Mr. Lloyd George insists that there must be &ldquo;no next
time.&rdquo; Viscount Grey warns us that if the world cannot organize
against war, if war must go on,
<!-- Page 205 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
&ldquo;then nations can protect themselves henceforth only by using
whatever destructive agencies they can invent, till the resources and
inventions of science end by destroying the humanity they were meant
to serve.&rdquo; Leagues of nations are proposed, organization for
peace on a scale commensurate with the past organization for war is
recognized as the principal task of international co-operation.</p>

<p>This new revolt against war is inseparable from the religious
revival of the time. The word &ldquo;revival&rdquo; conjures up
memories of less strenuous times, when men were concerned with smaller
problems, and uninspired by the bitter experience of the
present&mdash;Spurgeon thundering in his Tabernacle, Salvation Army
meetings, small gatherings in wayside villages, at which howling
sinners were converted and revivalists counted their game by the
dozen. The present revival is something for which the past provides no
analogy. It is not concerned so much with individual salvation as with
the salvation of the race and the world.  The petty sins and
shortcomings which brought men to the confessional and to the stool of
repentance lose importance when compared with the awful omissions
which we now recognize as the cause of the calamities
<!-- Page 206 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
which have befallen us. It is not only the existence of war that is
rousing the conscience. War is seen to be but a symptom, a horrible
outbreak of malignant forces, which we have nurtured and harboured in
times of peace. These forces permeate the very structure of society. A
new and fierce light beats on our slums, our industrialism, on the old
divisions of class and quality, on the standards of comfort and
success.  Poverty, sickness, and child mortality&mdash;the whole
hideous war of Mammon through which millions of our fellow-creatures
are condemned to the perpetual service of Want&mdash;can no longer
conveniently be left outside the operations of our religious
consciousness.</p>

<p>One thing is certain: we can no longer be satisfied with a religion
which pays lip-service to God, and offers propitiating incense to His
wrath, whilst it ignores the misery and the suffering of those who
have no reason to offer thanksgiving. Religious profession and
religious action will have to be unified. The sense of social
responsibility is slowly but surely taking the place of the anxiety to
assure one's own salvation. Some churches are empty, dead; they have
no message for the people, no vision wherewith to inspire the young.
<!-- Page 207 -->

They might with advantage close, and their clergy be employed upon
some useful national service. Ritual and incantations are doubtless
useful aids to religious worship and the necessary quietude of mind,
but they are losing their hold over souls to whom religious life has
become a matter of social service. These are of the order spoken of by
Ernest Crosby:</p>

<div class="blockwide">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">None could tell me where my soul might be.</span>
<span class="i0">I searched for God, but God eluded me.</span>
<span class="i0">I sought my brother out&mdash;and found all three.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The number of &ldquo;unbelievers&rdquo; is growing. There are
certain doctrines which we cannot believe because they violate our
reason, or our sense of justice and fair play. Centuries ago it may
have been possible to believe them: that is no concern of ours. To
each age its own mind and its own enlightenment. What is more
disquieting to the rulers of orthodoxy is that we do not care, that we
cannot believe in certain doctrines. Doctrines are at a discount just
now. The Church may quarrel over Kikuyu, or the Apostolic Succession,
or the Virgin Birth, or marvel at the new possibility of a canon of
the Church of England preaching a sermon in the City Temple. We feel
that
<!-- Page 208 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
it is infinitely more important that a few experiments in practical
Christianity should be imposed on the world. Religion in the past has
been conceived as essentially a matter of suppressing the intellect,
submitting to oppression and injustice, learning to bear patiently the
inflictions of Providence.  Religion in the future will demand all the
attention which our feeble intellect can offer it, and the conscious
and willing co-operation of mankind in the realization of God's plans
for a regenerated world.</p>

<p>Whilst the Churches addicted to ritualism and literalism decline,
the Brotherhood movement gains in force and influence. Men meet to
give united expression to their religious impulses. They meet for
prayer and worship, but never without immediate bearing on some great
social question or object. Opinions are freely expressed. Heterodoxy
in details of faith is rampant, and is no obstacle to Christian
fellowship. To the Sunday afternoon and evening gatherings of the
Brotherhood flock the many to whom the Bible is still a source of
spiritual food, and who demand a plain and practical interpretation of
its teachings. An impromptu prayer, in which the keynote is the loving
fatherhood of God, and its bearing on the brotherhood
<!-- Page 209 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
of man, precedes a homely address or sermon, closely packed with
allusions to social and political questions.  Or the address is
entirely secular; a downright unbeliever has been invited to give the
audience the benefit of his knowledge or experience, in connection
with some great movement for the betterment of the world.  There is a
disinclination to criticize anybody's religious views, provided he
shows by his acts and life that he is part of the new Ministry of
Humanity. Here we have the pivot of the change which is overtaking the
forms of religious expression.</p>

<p>Men are no longer content to regard this world as a hopeless place
of squalor and sin, as intrinsically and incurably wicked, as an abode
which cannot be mended and which must, therefore, be despised and
forsaken in spirit, even before the time when it has to be forsaken in
body. The possible flawlessness of an other-worldly state no longer
compensates for the glaring faults of this. This is no sign of the
weakening of the spiritual hold on reality. It is a sign of the
spiritualization of the values of life. It is a sign that we begin to
understand that we <i>are</i> spirits here, now, and everywhere, that
we see that time in this world and the
<!-- Page 210 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
way we employ it have a profound bearing on eternity. There is no
reason, in the name of God or man, why we should be content to let
this world remain a place of torment and foolishness, if we have
reached a point when we can see the better way.  There is a certain
type of religious mind which dreads the idea of social reconstruction,
on the assumption that we shall not long for heaven if conditions here
below are made less hellish.</p>

<p>There is also a type of churchman whose finer sensibilities are
sorely tried by the secular occupations of nonconformity in
general. If once or twice in their lives they should stray amongst
Congregationalists, Baptists, or Methodists, they come away disgusted
at the brutal directness with which social evils are exposed in the
light of the word of the Lord. They complain of the general lack of
finesse and Latin; the licence of the pulpit has usurped the reverence
of the altar. It is perfectly true that statements are sometimes made
in nonconformist pulpits which are bald and offensive to the ear of
scholarly accomplishment. But the complaint of secularization is
singularly inept.  Nothing could be more secular in the way of
complacent acceptance of the worldly
<!-- Page 211 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
reasons for leaving awkward questions alone than the attitude of this
type of critic.</p>

<p>The future life of Christianity is safely vested in the <i>free</i>
Churches.  The freedom will be progressive, and may possibly embrace a
vista of unfettered interpretation and application of Christian
knowledge which will be as remote from the dogmatism of to-day as is
our present attitude from the intolerance which kindled the
Inquisition and made possible the night of St. Bartholomew. Religious
intolerance has already lost three-fourths of its hold on
faith. Catholic will now slaughter Catholic without the stimulus to
hostility afforded by heretical opinions. Protestants are not
restrained from injuring each other by the common bond of detestation
of the adherents to papacy. The decline of intolerance is a direct
consequence of the externalization of the religious life. Rationalists
constantly mistake this process for the degeneration of religion. They
fail to see the simple fact that men can afford to dispense with the
paraphernalia of elaborate and artificial aids to the worship of God
when they feel His presence within their own souls and unmistakably
hear His call to action.</p>

<p>Some will see in the decay of intolerance an
<!-- Page 212 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
indication of the general evaporation of Christian articles of faith,
and the possible loss of identity in some new form of religion. There
is no danger. No religion can live in opposition to the evolution of
the human spirit. It must be sufficiently deep to meet the most
exacting need of individual religious experience, and it must be
sufficiently broad and elastic to correspond to the ever-changing
phenomena of social evolution. Christianity has this depth and this
breadth. Two parallel lines of its development are clearly discernible
at the present time. One is the transubstantiation of faith in social
service; the other is a demand for individualized experience of
spiritual realities. It is becoming more and more difficult to believe
a thing simply because you are told you ought to believe it, or
because your father and grandfather believed it.  Authority in matters
religious is being superseded by exploration. He who feels with
Swinburne that</p>

<div class="blockquote center">Save his own soul he has no star,</div>

<p style="text-indent: 0em">and he for whom space is peopled with
living souls mounting the ladder to the throne of God, share the
desire to experience the truth. Mysticism is passing through strange
phases
<!-- Page 213 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
of resurrection. Its modern garb is made up of all the hues of the
past, and, in addition, contains some up-to-date threads of severely
utilitarian composition. The number of those who claim direct
experience of spiritual verity as against mere hearsay is greater than
ever. The discovery of the soul is attracting students of every
description. The powers of suggestion, and the creative possibilities
of the subconscious mind, have opened up new fields of religious
experiment and adventure. The art of controlling the mind, so as to
make it immune against the depredations<!--Typo: depradations--> of
evil thought, or fear, or worry, is pursued by crowds of amateur
psychologists who delight in the happy results. They are learning to
live in tune with the infinite or cultivating optimism with complete
success. To the objection that they live in an artificial paradise
they reply that thought is the essence of things, and that they are
but carrying into practice the oft-repeated belief that we <i>are</i>
such stuff as dreams are made of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Religion,&rdquo; says Professor William James in <i>The
Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, &ldquo;in short, is a
monumental chapter in the history of human egoism. The Gods believed
in&mdash;whether by
<!-- Page 214 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
crude savages or by men disciplined intellectually&mdash;agree with
each other in recognizing a personal call.&rdquo; How could it be
otherwise? The solitariness of each human soul is the first fact in
religious consciousness. Altruism and communion with other souls are
perforce attained through concern with the state of the ego. The
spiritual egoism which demands pure thought, peace wherein to gather
impressions of goodness, beauty, and truth, time for the analysis of
psychic law, direct knowledge which is proof against the disease of
doubt, is, after all, the most valuable contribution which the
individual can make to society. The people who are now greatly
concerned with the exact temperature of their own minds are, at any
rate, to be congratulated on having made the discovery, which is
centuries overdue, that hygiene of the soul is more important than
hygiene of the body.</p>

<p>Placid contentment with the religious systems of the past is
greatly disturbed by this assertiveness. There is a demand for a new
message, couched in terms suited to the mental level of the twentieth
century. A message delivered two thousand years ago to a small
pastoral people, altogether innocent of the complicated
<!-- Page 215 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
economic, and industrial conditions of our times, must necessarily
appear incomplete to minds which can only reproduce the simplicity by
an effort of the imagination.  Jesus, they maintain, was a Jew who
spoke to Jews, and who had to deal with simple fishermen and
agriculturists, with Eastern merchants and narrow-minded scribes. He
never met great financiers to whose chariots of gold whole populations
are chained, or great masters of industry who profitably run a
thousand mills where human flesh and bone are ground in the production
of wealth. He knew naught, they feel, of the history of philosophy, or
the psychology of religion, or the researches of physiology and
chemistry. His language, coming to us as it does through the medium of
interpreters of a bygone age, and through the simple symbols of less
sophisticated minds, has poetic beauty, but lacks our modern
comprehensiveness.</p>

<p>There is a feeling that it is unreasonable to believe that God
spoke once or twice, thousands of years ago, and that He cannot or
will not speak now. Revelation cannot have been final; it must surely
be progressive, gradual, fitted to the needs and the receptivity of
souls.  The written word is not the only word. The living
<!-- Page 216 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
word must be spoken now, and will be spoken with greater effectiveness
in the future. Hence the expectation that a new world-teacher will
appear, that a master will be born who will gather up the truth and
the inspiration of the creeds of the past and present them, together
with a new message, suited to the hunger of to-day. Theosophists have
lately made the idea of the coming of such a teacher the central hope
of social regeneration.</p>

<p>They assume that when the teacher comes all the world will listen
and obey. It seems to me that teacher after teacher has uttered the
truth&mdash;Hermes, Zoroaster, Buddha, Confucius, Orpheus,
Jesus&mdash;and that the trouble is not lack of teachers but lack of
disciples. In the teachings of Jesus Christ, the world has a model
wherewith to mould the old order of hate and selfishness into a new
rule of love and brotherhood. The model has never been used; no
serious and far-reaching attempt has as yet been made to give
Christianity a politico-social trial. Why should a new world-teacher
be more successful? What guarantee is there that his voice would not
be drowned in the general clamour of the truth-mongers of the
marketplace? And the tendency of the modern religious
<!-- Page 217 -->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
consciousness is to seek reality personally, to develop the latent
faculties by which experience can be won, and to delve fearlessly into
the hidden depth of the soul in search of truth.</p>

<p>The great religions of the past have given the bread of life to
countless souls. They have all provided ways and means for our ethical
evolution. Religious eclecticism is natural to the cultured mind,
which can no longer be held back by any threats of
excommunication. The essence of religion, and the way of salvation,
have been found along widely divergent paths and under many names. One
thing is certain amidst innumerable uncertainties: the secret of
finding God can only be unravelled when we find our own souls.</p>

<p>It is the writer's object to indicate the nature of the struggle
which will confront the public of this country for the achievement of
political and industrial democracy when the war is over. The economic
roots of Militarism and of the confederacy of reactionary influences
which are found supporting it&mdash;Imperialism, Protectionism,
Conservatism, Bureaucracy, Capitalism&mdash;are subjected to a
critical analysis. The safeguarding and furtherance of the interests
of Improperty and Profiteering are exhibited as the directing and
moulding influences of domestic and foreign policy, and their
exploitation of other more disinterested motives is traced in the
conduct of Parties, Church, Press, and various educational and other
social institutions. The latter portion of the book discusses the
policy by which these hostile forces may be overcome and Democracy may
be achieved, and contains a vigorous plea for a new free policy of
popular education.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M. Riou is rather more than a simple soldier. He is a writer
of great gifts&mdash;narrative power, humour, tenderness, and
philosophical insight.  Moreover, his exceptional knowledge of Germany
gives special value to his account of his experiences as a prisoner of
war.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>What is the true Shaw? In this work Mr.&nbsp;Skimpole takes a new
view-point of Shaw the Man, and depicts him not as a living legend,
but as a very contemporary human being. There are keen and clear-cut
analyses of the Shavian plays; and not of least interest to literary
students will be the author's conclusions as to Shaw's future in
relation to the theatre.</p>
